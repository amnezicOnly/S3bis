her
mom
had
warned
her
she
had
been
warned
time
and
again
but
she
had
refused
to
believe
her
she
had
done
everything
right
and
she
knew
she
would
be
rewarded
for
doing
so
with
the
promotion
so
when
the
promotion
was
given
to
her
main
rival
it
not
only
stung
it
threw
her
belief
system
into
disarray
it
was
her
first
big
lesson
in
life
but
not
the
last
it
was
a
scrape
that
he
hardly
noticed
sure
there
was
a
bit
of
blood
but
it
was
minor
compared
to
most
of
the
other
cuts
and
bruises
he
acquired
on
his
adventures
there
was
no
way
he
could
know
that
the
rock
that
produced
the
cut
had
alien
genetic
material
on
it
that
was
now
racing
through
his
bloodstream
he
felt
perfectly
normal
and
continued
his
adventure
with
no
knowledge
of
what
was
about
to
happen
to
him
she
tried
to
explain
that
love
wasnt
like
pie
there
wasnt
a
set
number
of
slices
to
be
given
out
there
wasnt
less
to
be
given
to
one
person
if
you
wanted
to
give
more
to
another
that
after
a
set
amount
was
given
out
it
would
all
disappear
she
tried
to
explain
this
but
it
fell
on
deaf
ears
he
lifted
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
he
had
tasted
this
before
but
he
couldnt
quite
remember
the
time
and
place
it
had
happened
he
desperately
searched
his
mind
trying
to
locate
and
remember
where
he
had
tasted
this
when
the
bicycle
ran
over
his
foot
at
that
moment
he
had
a
thought
that
hed
never
imagine
hed
consider
i
could
just
cheat
he
thought
and
that
would
solve
the
problem
he
tried
to
move
on
from
the
thought
but
it
was
persistent
it
didnt
want
to
go
away
and
if
he
was
honest
with
himself
he
didnt
want
it
to
it
seemed
like
it
should
have
been
so
simple
there
was
nothing
inherently
difficult
with
getting
the
project
done
it
was
simple
and
straightforward
enough
that
even
a
child
should
have
been
able
to
complete
it
on
time
but
that
wasnt
the
case
the
deadline
had
arrived
and
the
project
remained
unfinished
it
had
been
a
simple
realization
that
had
changed
debras
life
perspective
it
was
really
so
simple
that
she
was
embarrassed
that
she
had
lived
the
previous
five
years
with
the
way
she
measured
her
worth
now
that
she
saw
what
she
had
been
doing
she
could
see
how
sad
it
was
that
made
her
all
the
more
relieved
she
had
made
the
change
the
number
of
hearts
her
instagram
posts
received
wasnt
any
longer
the
indication
of
her
own
selfworth
im
heading
back
to
colorado
tomorrow
after
being
down
in
santa
barbara
over
the
weekend
for
the
festival
there
i
will
be
making
october
plans
once
there
and
will
try
to
arrange
so
im
back
here
for
the
birthday
if
possible
ill
let
you
know
as
soon
as
i
know
the
doctors
appointment
schedule
and
my
flight
plans
the
rain
was
coming
everyone
thought
this
would
be
a
good
thing
it
hadnt
rained
in
months
and
the
earth
was
dry
as
a
bone
it
wasnt
a
surprise
that
everyone
thought
a
good
rain
was
what
was
needed
but
they
never
expected
how
much
rain
would
actually
arrive
the
alarm
went
off
at
exactly
am
as
it
had
every
morning
for
the
past
five
years
barbara
began
her
morning
and
was
ready
to
eat
breakfast
by
am
the
day
appeared
to
be
as
normal
as
any
other
but
that
was
about
to
change
in
fact
it
was
going
to
change
at
exactly
am
it
was
going
to
rain
the
weather
forecast
didnt
say
that
but
the
steel
plate
in
his
hip
did
he
had
learned
over
the
years
to
trust
his
hip
over
the
weatherman
it
was
going
to
rain
so
he
better
get
outside
and
prepare
the
bowl
was
filled
with
fruit
it
seemed
to
be
an
overabundance
of
strawberries
but
it
also
included
blueberries
raspberries
grapes
and
banana
slices
this
was
the
meal
sarah
had
every
morning
to
start
her
day
since
she
could
remember
why
she
decided
to
add
chocolate
as
an
option
today
was
still
a
bit
of
a
surprise
but
she
had
been
in
the
process
of
deciding
she
wanted
to
change
her
routine
this
was
a
baby
step
to
begin
that
start
wandering
down
the
path
to
the
pond
had
become
a
daily
routine
even
when
the
weather
wasnt
cooperating
like
today
with
the
wind
and
rain
jerry
still
took
the
morning
stroll
down
the
path
until
he
reached
the
pond
although
there
didnt
seem
to
be
a
particular
reason
jerry
did
this
to
anyone
looking
in
from
the
outside
those
who
knew
him
well
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on
it
could
all
be
traced
back
to
a
specific
incident
that
happened
exactly
years
previously
he
had
disappointed
himself
more
than
anyone
else
that
wasnt
to
say
that
he
hadnt
disappointed
others
the
fact
was
that
he
had
disappointed
a
lot
of
people
who
were
close
to
him
the
fact
that
they
were
disappointed
in
him
was
something
that
made
him
even
more
disappointed
in
himself
yet
here
he
was
about
to
do
the
exact
same
things
that
had
caused
all
the
disappointment
in
the
first
place
because
he
didnt
know
what
else
to
do
sometimes
thats
just
the
way
it
has
to
be
sure
there
were
probably
other
options
but
he
didnt
let
them
enter
his
mind
it
was
done
and
that
was
that
it
was
just
the
way
it
had
to
be
explain
to
me
again
why
i
shouldnt
cheat
he
asked
all
the
others
do
and
nobody
ever
gets
punished
for
doing
so
i
should
go
about
being
happy
losing
to
cheaters
because
i
know
that
i
dont
thats
what
youre
telling
me
a
twoinch
layer
of
freshly
fallen
snow
covered
the
yard
stacey
peeked
outside
to
most
it
would
have
been
a
beautiful
sight
worthy
of
taking
a
photo
to
put
on
instagram
for
stacey
it
meant
something
different
the
first
snow
of
the
year
brought
back
the
witches
as
the
fairies
in
the
yard
had
to
seek
shelter
to
avoid
the
cold
the
words
hadnt
flowed
from
his
fingers
for
the
past
few
weeks
he
never
imagined
hed
find
himself
with
writers
block
but
here
he
sat
with
a
blank
screen
in
front
of
him
that
blank
screen
taunting
him
day
after
day
had
started
to
play
with
his
mind
he
didnt
understand
why
he
couldnt
even
type
a
single
word
just
one
to
begin
the
process
and
build
from
there
and
yet
he
already
knew
that
the
eight
hours
he
was
prepared
to
sit
in
front
of
his
computer
today
would
end
with
the
screen
remaining
blank
rhonda
prided
herself
on
always
taking
the
path
less
traveled
shed
decided
to
do
this
at
an
early
age
and
had
continued
to
do
so
throughout
her
entire
life
it
was
a
point
of
pride
and
she
would
explain
to
anyone
who
would
listen
that
doing
so
was
something
that
shed
made
great
efforts
to
always
do
shed
never
questioned
this
decision
until
her
fiveyearold
niece
asked
her
so
is
this
why
your
life
has
been
so
difficult
and
rhonda
didnt
have
an
answer
for
her
why
do
americans
have
so
many
different
types
of
towels
we
have
beach
towels
hand
towels
bath
towels
dish
towels
camping
towels
quickdry
towels
and
lets
not
forget
paper
towels
would
type
of
towel
work
for
each
of
these
things
lets
take
a
beach
towel
it
can
be
used
to
dry
your
hands
and
body
with
no
difficulty
a
beach
towel
could
be
used
to
dry
dishes
just
think
how
many
dishes
you
could
dry
with
one
beach
towel
ive
used
a
beach
towel
with
no
adverse
effects
while
camping
if
you
buy
a
thin
beach
towel
it
can
dry
quickly
too
id
probably
cut
up
a
beach
towel
to
wipe
down
counters
or
for
cleaning
other
items
but
a
full
beach
towel
could
be
used
too
is
having
so
many
types
of
towels
an
extravagant
luxury
that
americans
enjoy
or
is
it
necessary
id
say
its
overkill
and
we
could
cut
down
on
the
many
types
of
towels
that
manufacturers
deem
necessary
he
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
he
wasnt
sure
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
but
at
this
moment
it
didnt
matter
she
had
made
it
especially
for
him
so
he
would
have
forced
it
down
even
if
he
had
absolutely
hated
it
thats
simply
the
way
things
worked
she
made
him
a
newfangled
drink
each
day
and
he
took
a
sip
of
it
and
smiled
saying
it
was
excellent
it
had
been
a
rough
day
things
hadnt
gone
as
planned
and
that
meant
hannah
got
yelled
at
by
her
boss
it
didnt
even
matter
that
it
wasnt
her
fault
when
things
went
wrong
at
work
hannah
got
the
blame
no
matter
the
actual
circumstances
it
wasnt
fair
but
there
was
little
she
could
do
without
risking
her
job
and
she
wasnt
in
a
position
to
do
that
with
the
plans
she
had
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
one
more
step
and
then
one
more
jacks
only
thoughts
were
to
keep
moving
no
matter
how
much
his
body
screamed
to
stop
and
rest
hes
lost
almost
all
his
energy
and
his
entire
body
ached
beyond
belief
but
he
forced
himself
to
take
another
step
then
another
and
then
one
more
they
had
no
proof
he
knew
that
they
knew
he
had
done
it
but
they
didnt
have
any
proof
it
was
a
huge
distinction
and
it
was
the
difference
between
him
keeping
his
freedom
or
being
locked
away
for
decades
they
continued
to
question
him
probing
him
for
information
that
they
could
use
against
him
or
find
the
proof
they
needed
to
put
him
away
he
smiled
and
continued
to
block
their
every
inquiry
by
feigning
his
innocence
for
a
crime
they
all
knew
he
committed
all
he
wanted
was
a
candy
bar
it
didnt
seem
like
a
difficult
request
to
comprehend
but
the
clerk
remained
frozen
and
didnt
seem
to
want
to
honor
the
request
it
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
gun
pointed
at
his
face
the
amber
droplet
hung
from
the
branch
reaching
fullness
and
ready
to
drop
it
waited
while
many
of
the
other
droplets
were
satisfied
to
form
as
big
as
they
could
and
release
this
droplet
had
other
plans
it
wanted
to
be
part
of
history
it
wanted
to
be
remembered
long
after
all
the
other
droplets
had
dissolved
into
history
so
it
waited
for
the
perfect
specimen
to
fly
by
to
trap
and
capture
that
it
hoped
would
eventually
be
discovered
hundreds
of
years
in
the
future
he
slowly
poured
the
drink
over
a
large
chunk
of
ice
he
has
especially
chiseled
off
a
larger
block
he
didnt
particularly
like
his
drinks
cold
but
he
knew
that
the
drama
of
chiseling
the
ice
and
then
pouring
a
drink
over
it
looked
far
more
impressive
than
how
he
actually
liked
it
it
was
all
about
image
and
hed
managed
to
perfect
the
image
that
he
wanted
to
project
i
guess
we
could
discuss
the
implications
of
the
phrase
meant
to
be
that
is
if
we
wanted
to
drown
ourselves
in
a
sea
of
backwardly
referential
semantics
and
other
mumbojumbo
maybe
such
a
discussion
would
result
in
the
determination
that
meant
to
be
is
exactly
as
meaningless
a
phrase
as
it
seems
to
be
and
that
none
of
us
is
actually
meant
to
be
doing
anything
at
all
but
thats
my
existential
underpants
underpinnings
showing
its
the
way
the
cookie
crumbles
and
now
i
want
a
cookie
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
more
that
could
be
done
it
had
become
a
waitandsee
situation
with
the
final
results
no
longer
in
her
control
that
didnt
stop
her
from
trying
to
control
the
situation
she
demanded
that
things
be
done
as
she
desperately
tried
to
control
what
couldnt
be
so
what
do
you
think
he
asked
nervously
he
wanted
to
know
the
answer
but
at
the
same
time
he
didnt
hed
put
his
heart
and
soul
into
the
project
and
he
wasnt
sure
hed
be
able
to
recover
if
they
didnt
like
what
he
produced
the
silence
from
the
others
in
the
room
seemed
to
last
a
lifetime
even
though
it
had
only
been
a
moment
since
he
asked
the
question
so
what
do
you
think
he
asked
again
she
sat
in
the
darkened
room
waiting
it
was
now
a
standoff
he
had
the
power
to
put
her
in
the
room
but
not
the
power
to
make
her
repent
it
wasnt
fair
and
no
matter
how
long
she
had
to
endure
the
darkness
she
wouldnt
change
her
attitude
at
three
years
old
sandys
stubborn
personality
had
already
bloomed
into
full
view
he
stepped
away
from
the
mic
this
was
the
best
take
he
had
done
so
far
but
something
seemed
missing
then
it
struck
him
all
at
once
visuals
ran
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
music
rang
in
his
ears
his
eager
fingers
went
to
work
in
an
attempt
to
capture
his
thoughts
hoping
the
results
would
produce
something
that
was
at
least
half
their
glory
puppies
are
soft
cute
funny
and
make
a
big
mess
every
month
or
two
our
family
fosters
week
old
puppies
for
a
puppy
rescue
nonprofit
organization
we
all
enjoy
cuddling
their
furry
bodies
after
a
clean
bath
fresh
puppy
smell
is
great
the
puppies
play
with
each
other
and
our
adult
dog
they
look
so
funny
when
they
lay
on
top
of
each
other
and
sleep
while
puppies
can
be
great
fun
they
also
can
make
big
messes
puppies
can
make
a
lot
of
puppy
pee
and
poop
its
a
challenge
to
keep
the
puppies
and
the
puppy
pen
clean
he
wondered
if
he
should
disclose
the
truth
to
his
friends
it
would
be
a
risky
move
yes
the
truth
would
make
things
a
lot
easier
if
they
all
stayed
on
the
same
page
but
the
truth
might
fracture
the
group
leaving
everything
in
even
more
of
a
mess
than
it
was
not
telling
the
truth
it
was
time
to
decide
which
way
to
go
she
was
aware
that
things
could
go
wrong
in
fact
she
had
trained
her
entire
life
in
anticipation
that
things
would
go
wrong
one
day
she
had
quiet
confidence
as
she
started
to
see
that
this
was
the
day
that
all
her
training
would
be
worthwhile
and
useful
at
this
point
she
had
no
idea
just
how
wrong
everything
would
go
that
day
sometimes
there
isnt
a
good
answer
no
matter
how
you
try
to
rationalize
the
outcome
it
doesnt
make
sense
and
instead
of
an
answer
you
are
simply
left
with
a
question
why
he
watched
as
the
young
man
tried
to
impress
everyone
in
the
room
with
his
intelligence
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
smart
the
fact
that
he
was
more
intelligent
than
anyone
else
in
the
room
could
have
been
easily
deduced
but
nobody
was
really
paying
any
attention
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
also
obvious
that
the
young
man
only
cared
about
his
intelligence
she
had
been
an
angel
for
coming
up
on
years
and
in
all
that
time
nobody
had
told
her
this
was
possible
the
fact
that
it
could
ever
happen
never
even
entered
her
mind
yet
there
she
stood
with
the
undeniable
evidence
sitting
on
the
ground
before
her
angels
could
lose
their
wings
pink
ponies
and
purple
giraffes
roamed
the
field
cotton
candy
grew
from
the
ground
as
a
chocolate
river
meandered
off
to
the
side
what
looked
like
stones
in
the
pasture
were
actually
rock
candy
everything
in
her
dream
seemed
to
be
perfect
except
for
the
fact
that
she
had
no
mouth
there
was
only
half
a
worm
in
the
apple
at
first
judy
didnt
quite
comprehend
what
this
meant
why
would
only
half
a
worm
be
living
in
an
apple
she
wondered
and
then
it
dawned
on
her
judy
quickly
spit
out
the
bite
she
had
just
taken
expecting
to
see
the
other
half
of
the
worm
it
ended
up
being
much
worse
than
that
im
so
confused
by
your
ridiculous
meltdown
that
i
must
insist
on
some
sort
of
explanation
for
your
behavior
towards
me
it
just
doesnt
make
any
sense
theres
no
way
that
i
deserved
the
treatment
you
gave
me
without
an
explanation
or
an
apology
for
how
out
of
line
you
have
been
the
day
had
begun
on
a
bright
note
the
sun
finally
peeked
through
the
rain
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
and
the
birds
were
singing
in
its
warmth
there
was
no
way
to
anticipate
what
was
about
to
happen
it
was
a
worstcase
scenario
and
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
it
really
didnt
matter
what
they
did
to
him
hes
already
made
up
his
mind
whatever
came
his
way
he
was
prepared
for
the
consequences
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
the
sacrifice
he
made
was
done
with
love
and
not
hate
no
matter
how
others
decided
to
spin
it
heres
the
thing
she
doesnt
have
anything
to
prove
but
she
is
going
to
anyway
thats
just
her
character
she
knows
she
doesnt
have
to
but
she
still
will
just
to
show
you
that
she
can
doubt
her
more
and
shell
prove
she
can
again
we
all
already
know
this
and
you
will
too
one
dollar
and
eightyseven
cents
that
was
all
and
sixty
cents
of
it
was
in
pennies
pennies
saved
one
and
two
at
a
time
by
bulldozing
the
grocer
and
the
vegetable
man
and
the
butcher
until
ones
cheeks
burned
with
the
silent
imputation
of
parsimony
that
such
close
dealing
implied
one
dollar
and
eightyseven
cents
and
the
next
day
would
be
christmas
he
heard
the
crack
echo
in
the
late
afternoon
about
a
mile
away
his
heart
started
racing
and
he
bolted
into
a
full
sprint
it
wasnt
a
gunshot
it
wasnt
a
gunshot
he
repeated
under
his
breathlessness
as
he
continued
to
sprint
welcome
to
my
world
you
will
be
greeted
by
the
unexpected
here
and
your
mind
will
be
challenged
and
expanded
in
ways
that
you
never
thought
possible
that
is
if
you
are
able
to
survive
it
was
a
simple
green
chair
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
or
so
it
seemed
it
was
the
type
of
chair
one
would
pass
without
even
noticing
it
was
there
let
alone
what
the
actual
color
of
it
was
it
was
due
to
this
common
and
unassuming
appearance
that
few
people
actually
stopped
to
sit
in
it
and
discover
its
magical
powers
my
pincher
collar
is
snapped
on
then
comes
the
electric
zapper
collar
finally
my
purple
athome
collar
is
taken
off
and
i
know
im
going
for
a
walk
to
the
dog
park
im
so
excited
to
see
my
friends
i
hope
spike
or
thunder
are
there
already
theyre
the
most
fun
to
chase
and
tumble
with
my
human
is
pretty
strict
with
me
im
only
allowed
on
the
grass
and
not
on
the
sidewalks
i
think
shes
afraid
im
going
to
jump
on
the
other
humans
i
dont
understand
why
everyone
else
gets
to
jump
on
the
benches
and
run
wild
on
the
sidewalks
they
dont
listen
to
their
humans
i
know
i
could
ignore
mine
but
if
i
do
she
may
zap
me
and
its
just
not
worth
it
she
probably
wouldnt
let
me
back
at
the
dog
park
if
i
didnt
listen
to
her
i
just
love
the
dog
park
it
had
been
a
late
night
to
be
more
correct
it
had
been
an
early
morning
it
was
now
am
and
george
was
just
getting
home
he
wasnt
sure
if
it
had
been
worth
it
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
finished
by
pm
but
his
boss
had
implored
him
to
stay
and
help
when
it
was
clear
they
werent
going
to
meet
the
pm
target
time
so
he
had
stayed
an
extra
hours
and
lost
a
good
nights
sleep
for
something
he
didnt
really
believe
in
but
he
did
anyway
because
he
was
afraid
if
he
refused
he
might
lose
his
job
waiting
and
watching
it
was
all
she
had
done
for
the
past
weeks
when
youre
locked
in
a
room
with
nothing
but
food
and
drink
thats
about
all
you
can
do
anyway
she
watched
as
birds
flew
past
the
window
bolted
shut
she
couldnt
reach
it
if
she
wanted
too
with
that
hole
in
the
floor
she
thought
she
could
escape
through
it
but
three
stories
is
a
bit
far
down
he
sat
staring
at
the
person
in
the
train
stopped
at
the
station
going
in
the
opposite
direction
she
sat
staring
ahead
never
noticing
that
she
was
being
watched
both
trains
began
to
move
and
he
knew
that
in
another
timeline
or
in
another
universe
they
had
been
happy
together
he
hid
under
the
covers
hoping
that
nobody
would
notice
him
there
it
really
didnt
make
much
sense
since
it
would
be
obvious
to
anyone
who
walked
into
the
room
there
was
someone
hiding
there
but
he
still
held
out
hope
he
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
hall
and
stop
in
front
in
front
of
the
bedroom
door
he
heard
the
squeak
of
the
door
hinges
and
someone
opened
the
bedroom
door
he
held
his
breath
waiting
for
whoever
was
about
to
discover
him
but
they
never
did
twentyfive
years
dana
had
been
waiting
she
tried
to
be
patient
during
that
time
but
she
hadnt
always
managed
to
be
as
patient
as
shed
like
but
today
the
opportunity
had
finally
come
the
thing
she
always
imagined
would
make
her
the
happiest
person
in
the
world
was
about
to
happen
she
didnt
know
why
at
this
specific
time
she
all
of
a
sudden
felt
sick
inside
what
were
the
chances
it
would
have
to
be
a
lot
more
than
to
it
was
likely
even
more
than
to
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
odds
of
it
happening
had
to
be
more
than
to
and
even
to
people
often
threw
around
the
chances
of
something
happening
as
being
to
as
an
exaggeration
of
an
unlikely
event
but
he
could
see
that
they
may
actually
be
accurate
in
this
situation
whatever
the
odds
of
it
happening
he
knew
they
were
big
what
he
didnt
know
was
whether
this
happening
was
lucky
or
unlucky
im
going
to
hire
professional
help
tomorrow
i
cant
handle
this
anymore
she
fell
over
the
coffee
table
and
now
there
is
blood
in
her
catheter
this
is
much
more
than
i
ever
signed
up
to
do
with
six
children
in
tow
catherine
raced
to
the
airport
departing
gate
this
wasnt
an
easy
task
as
the
children
had
other
priorities
than
to
get
to
the
gate
she
knew
that
she
was
tight
on
time
and
the
frustration
came
out
as
she
yelled
at
the
kids
to
keep
up
they
continued
to
test
her
pretending
not
to
listen
and
to
move
in
directions
that
only
slowed
them
down
they
had
no
idea
the
wrath
they
were
about
to
receive
when
catherine
made
it
to
the
gate
only
to
be
informed
that
they
had
all
missed
the
plane
it
doesnt
take
much
to
touch
someones
heart
daisy
said
with
a
smile
on
her
face
its
often
just
the
little
things
you
do
that
can
change
a
persons
day
for
the
better
daisy
truly
believed
this
to
be
the
way
the
world
worked
but
she
didnt
understand
that
she
was
merely
a
robot
that
had
been
programmed
to
believe
this
he
walked
down
the
steps
from
the
train
station
in
a
bit
of
a
hurry
knowing
the
secrets
in
the
briefcase
must
be
secured
as
quickly
as
possible
bounding
down
the
steps
he
heard
something
behind
him
and
quickly
turned
in
a
panic
there
was
nobody
there
but
a
pair
of
old
wornout
shoes
were
placed
neatly
on
the
steps
he
had
just
come
down
had
he
past
them
without
seeing
them
it
didnt
seem
possible
he
was
about
to
turn
and
be
on
his
way
when
a
deep
chill
filled
his
body
rhonda
prided
herself
on
always
taking
the
path
less
traveled
shed
decided
to
do
this
at
an
early
age
and
had
continued
to
do
so
throughout
her
entire
life
it
was
a
point
of
pride
and
she
would
explain
to
anyone
who
would
listen
that
doing
so
was
something
that
shed
made
great
efforts
to
always
do
shed
never
questioned
this
decision
until
her
fiveyearold
niece
asked
her
so
is
this
why
your
life
has
been
so
difficult
and
rhonda
didnt
have
an
answer
for
her
twenty
seconds
were
all
that
was
left
and
richard
could
hear
each
one
tick
by
fifteen
seconds
now
remained
and
the
panic
began
to
fully
set
in
ten
seconds
and
he
wasnt
sure
he
had
enough
time
five
seconds
four
three
two
one
brock
would
have
never
dared
to
do
it
on
his
own
he
thought
to
himself
that
is
why
kenneth
and
he
had
become
such
good
friends
kenneth
forced
brock
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
made
him
try
new
things
hed
never
imagine
doing
otherwise
up
to
this
point
this
had
been
a
good
thing
it
had
expanded
brocks
experiences
and
given
him
a
new
appreciation
for
life
now
that
both
of
them
were
in
the
back
of
a
police
car
all
brock
could
think
was
that
he
would
have
never
dared
do
it
except
for
the
influence
of
kenneth
the
paper
was
blank
it
shouldnt
have
been
there
should
have
been
writing
on
the
paper
at
least
a
paragraph
if
not
more
the
fact
that
the
writing
wasnt
there
was
frustrating
actually
it
was
even
more
than
frustrating
it
was
downright
distressing
since
they
are
still
preserved
in
the
rocks
for
us
to
see
they
must
have
been
formed
quite
recently
that
is
geologically
speaking
what
can
explain
these
striations
and
their
common
orientation
did
you
ever
hear
about
the
great
ice
age
or
the
pleistocene
epoch
less
than
one
million
years
ago
in
fact
some
years
ago
an
ice
sheet
many
thousands
of
feet
thick
rode
over
burke
mountain
in
a
southeastward
direction
the
many
boulders
frozen
to
the
underside
of
the
ice
sheet
tended
to
scratch
the
rocks
over
which
they
rode
the
scratches
or
striations
seen
in
the
park
rocks
were
caused
by
these
attached
boulders
the
ice
sheet
also
plucked
and
rounded
burke
mountain
into
the
shape
it
possesses
today
it
was
a
question
of
which
of
the
two
she
preferred
on
the
one
hand
the
choice
seemed
simple
the
more
expensive
one
with
a
brand
name
would
be
the
choice
of
most
it
was
the
easy
choice
the
safe
choice
but
she
wasnt
sure
she
actually
preferred
it
the
fog
was
as
thick
as
pea
soup
this
was
a
problem
gary
was
driving
but
couldnt
see
a
thing
in
front
of
him
he
knew
he
should
stop
but
the
road
was
narrow
so
if
he
did
it
would
be
right
in
the
center
of
the
road
he
was
sure
that
another
car
would
end
up
rearending
him
so
he
continued
forward
despite
the
lack
of
visibility
this
was
an
unwise
move
sitting
in
the
sun
away
from
everyone
who
had
done
him
harm
in
the
past
he
quietly
listened
to
those
who
roamed
by
he
felt
at
peace
in
the
moment
hoping
it
would
last
but
knowing
the
reprieve
would
soon
come
to
an
end
he
closed
his
eyes
the
sun
beating
down
on
face
and
he
smiled
he
smiled
for
the
first
time
in
as
long
as
he
could
remember
he
stared
out
the
window
at
the
snowy
field
hed
been
stuck
in
the
house
for
close
to
a
month
and
his
only
view
of
the
outside
world
was
through
the
window
there
wasnt
much
to
see
it
was
mostly
just
the
field
with
an
occasional
bird
or
small
animal
who
ventured
into
the
field
as
he
continued
to
stare
out
the
window
he
wondered
how
much
longer
hed
be
shackled
to
the
steel
bar
inside
the
house
the
blinking
light
caught
her
attention
she
thought
about
it
a
bit
and
couldnt
remember
ever
noticing
it
before
that
was
strange
since
it
was
obvious
the
flashing
light
had
been
there
for
years
now
she
wondered
how
she
missed
it
for
that
amount
of
time
and
what
other
things
in
her
small
town
she
had
failed
to
notice
his
parents
continued
to
question
him
he
didnt
know
what
to
say
to
them
since
they
refused
to
believe
the
truth
he
explained
again
and
again
and
they
dismissed
his
explanation
as
a
figment
of
his
imagination
there
was
no
way
that
grandpa
who
had
been
dead
for
five
years
could
have
told
him
where
the
treasure
had
been
hidden
of
course
it
didnt
help
that
grandpa
was
roaring
with
laughter
in
the
chair
next
to
him
as
he
tried
to
explain
once
again
how
hed
found
it
it
was
easy
to
spot
her
all
you
needed
to
do
was
look
at
her
socks
they
were
never
a
matching
pair
one
would
be
green
while
the
other
would
be
blue
one
would
reach
her
knee
while
the
other
barely
touched
her
ankle
every
other
part
of
her
was
perfect
but
never
the
socks
they
were
her
micro
act
of
rebellion
as
she
sat
watching
the
world
go
by
something
caught
her
eye
it
wasnt
so
much
its
color
or
shape
but
the
way
it
was
moving
she
squinted
to
see
if
she
could
better
understand
what
it
was
and
where
it
was
going
but
it
didnt
help
as
she
continued
to
stare
into
the
distance
she
didnt
understand
why
this
uneasiness
was
building
inside
her
body
she
felt
like
she
should
get
up
and
run
if
only
she
could
make
out
what
it
was
at
that
moment
she
comprehended
what
it
was
and
where
it
was
heading
and
she
knew
her
life
would
never
be
the
same
it
wasnt
that
he
hated
her
it
was
simply
that
he
didnt
like
her
much
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
explain
this
to
her
and
even
more
difficult
for
her
to
truly
understand
she
was
in
love
and
wanted
him
to
feel
the
same
way
he
didnt
and
no
matter
how
he
tried
to
explain
to
her
she
refused
to
listen
or
to
understand
she
had
been
an
angel
for
coming
up
on
years
and
in
all
that
time
nobody
had
told
her
this
was
possible
the
fact
that
it
could
ever
happen
never
even
entered
her
mind
yet
there
she
stood
with
the
undeniable
evidence
sitting
on
the
ground
before
her
angels
could
lose
their
wings
they
had
no
proof
he
knew
that
they
knew
he
had
done
it
but
they
didnt
have
any
proof
it
was
a
huge
distinction
and
it
was
the
difference
between
him
keeping
his
freedom
or
being
locked
away
for
decades
they
continued
to
question
him
probing
him
for
information
that
they
could
use
against
him
or
find
the
proof
they
needed
to
put
him
away
he
smiled
and
continued
to
block
their
every
inquiry
by
feigning
his
innocence
for
a
crime
they
all
knew
he
committed
there
werent
supposed
to
be
dragons
flying
in
the
sky
first
and
foremost
dragons
didnt
exist
they
were
mythical
creatures
from
fantasy
books
like
unicorns
this
was
something
that
pete
knew
in
his
heart
to
be
true
so
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
acknowledging
that
there
were
actually
firebreathing
dragons
flying
in
the
sky
above
him
trees
it
was
something
about
the
trees
the
way
they
swayed
with
the
wind
in
unison
the
way
they
shaded
the
area
around
them
the
sounds
of
their
leaves
in
the
wind
and
the
creaks
from
the
branches
as
they
sway
the
trees
were
making
a
statement
that
i
just
couldnt
understand
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
he
couldnt
give
her
a
good
explanation
about
what
had
happened
it
didnt
even
really
make
sense
to
him
all
he
knew
was
that
he
froze
at
the
moment
and
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
to
react
nothing
in
his
body
allowed
him
to
move
it
was
as
if
he
had
instantly
become
a
statue
and
although
he
could
see
what
was
taking
place
he
couldnt
move
to
intervene
he
knew
that
wasnt
a
satisfactory
explanation
even
though
it
was
the
truth
at
that
moment
he
had
a
thought
that
hed
never
imagine
hed
consider
i
could
just
cheat
he
thought
and
that
would
solve
the
problem
he
tried
to
move
on
from
the
thought
but
it
was
persistent
it
didnt
want
to
go
away
and
if
he
was
honest
with
himself
he
didnt
want
it
to
there
had
to
be
a
better
way
thats
all
nancy
could
think
as
she
sat
at
her
desk
staring
at
her
computer
screen
shed
already
spent
five
years
of
her
life
in
this
little
cubicle
staring
at
her
computer
doing
work
that
didnt
seem
to
matter
to
anyone
including
her
own
boss
there
had
to
be
more
to
her
life
than
this
and
there
had
to
be
a
better
way
to
make
a
living
thats
what
she
was
thinking
when
the
earthquake
struck
she
patiently
waited
for
his
number
to
be
called
she
had
no
desire
to
be
there
but
her
mom
had
insisted
that
she
go
shes
resisted
at
first
but
over
time
she
realized
it
was
simply
easier
to
appease
her
and
go
mom
tended
to
be
that
way
she
would
keep
insisting
until
you
wore
down
and
did
what
she
wanted
so
here
she
sat
patiently
waiting
for
her
number
to
be
called
he
looked
at
the
sand
picking
up
a
handful
he
wondered
how
many
grains
were
in
his
hand
hundreds
of
thousands
not
enough
the
said
under
his
breath
i
need
more
he
scolded
himself
for
being
so
tentative
he
knew
he
shouldnt
be
so
cautious
but
there
was
a
sixth
sense
telling
him
that
things
werent
exactly
as
they
appeared
it
was
that
weird
chill
that
rolls
up
your
neck
and
makes
the
hair
stand
on
end
he
knew
that
being
so
tentative
could
end
up
costing
him
the
job
but
he
learned
that
listening
to
his
sixth
sense
usually
kept
him
from
getting
into
a
lot
of
trouble
her
breath
exited
her
mouth
in
big
puffs
as
if
she
were
smoking
a
cigarette
the
morning
dew
had
made
her
clothes
damp
and
she
shivered
from
the
chill
in
the
air
there
was
only
one
thing
that
could
get
her
up
and
out
this
early
in
the
morning
the
boy
walked
down
the
street
in
a
carefree
way
playing
without
notice
of
what
was
about
him
he
didnt
hear
the
sound
of
the
car
as
his
ball
careened
into
the
road
he
took
a
step
toward
it
and
in
doing
so
sealed
his
fate
stranded
yes
she
was
now
the
first
person
ever
to
land
on
venus
but
that
was
of
little
consequence
her
name
would
be
read
by
millions
in
school
as
the
first
to
land
here
but
that
celebrity
would
never
actually
be
seen
by
her
she
looked
at
the
control
panel
and
knew
there
was
nothing
that
would
ever
get
it
back
into
working
order
she
was
the
first
and
it
was
not
clear
this
would
also
be
her
last
cake
or
pie
i
can
tell
a
lot
about
you
by
which
one
you
pick
it
may
seem
silly
but
cake
people
and
pie
people
are
really
different
i
know
which
one
i
hope
you
are
but
thats
not
for
me
to
decide
so
what
is
it
cake
or
pie
sleeping
in
his
car
was
never
the
plan
but
sometimes
things
dont
work
out
as
planned
this
had
been
his
life
for
the
last
three
months
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
he
didnt
actually
enjoy
it
but
he
had
accepted
it
and
come
to
terms
with
it
or
at
least
he
thought
he
had
all
that
changed
when
he
put
the
key
into
the
ignition
turned
it
and
the
engine
didnt
make
a
sound
youre
going
to
make
a
choice
today
that
will
have
a
direct
impact
on
where
you
are
five
years
from
now
the
truth
is
youll
make
choice
like
that
every
day
of
your
life
the
problem
is
that
on
most
days
you
wont
know
the
choice
you
make
will
have
such
a
huge
impact
on
your
life
in
the
future
so
if
you
want
to
end
up
in
a
certain
place
in
the
future
you
need
to
be
careful
of
the
choices
you
make
today
housework
could
be
everyones
work
not
just
womens
work
why
do
women
enable
men
to
act
oblivious
to
cleaning
grocery
shopping
pet
feeding
etc
somehow
when
men
live
alone
they
figure
out
how
to
do
all
of
those
things
all
on
their
own
my
friends
husband
claimed
he
didnt
know
that
sheets
should
be
washed
more
than
once
a
season
he
said
he
didnt
know
one
had
to
clean
toilets
he
assumed
that
since
you
flush
toilets
they
clean
themselves
she
tried
to
get
him
to
help
but
he
did
an
awful
job
so
she
let
him
off
the
hook
wouldnt
it
be
better
if
she
spent
the
time
and
energy
to
get
him
to
do
it
right
instead
of
letting
him
claim
he
is
just
bad
at
it
my
sons
were
raised
to
clean
toilets
and
change
their
own
sheets
hopefully
in
their
future
homes
the
housework
will
be
equally
divided
it
had
been
a
simple
realization
that
had
changed
debras
life
perspective
it
was
really
so
simple
that
she
was
embarrassed
that
she
had
lived
the
previous
five
years
with
the
way
she
measured
her
worth
now
that
she
saw
what
she
had
been
doing
she
could
see
how
sad
it
was
that
made
her
all
the
more
relieved
she
had
made
the
change
the
number
of
hearts
her
instagram
posts
received
wasnt
any
longer
the
indication
of
her
own
selfworth
what
if
dogs
were
racist
would
they
care
about
fur
color
son
only
play
with
other
tan
dogs
or
maybe
it
would
depend
on
breed
honey
only
play
with
other
german
shepards
never
poodles
better
yet
it
could
depend
on
occupation
im
a
sled
dog
while
youre
only
a
running
companion
leave
me
alone
maybe
the
neighborhood
they
live
in
could
be
the
way
they
choose
which
dogs
to
associate
with
and
which
to
shun
size
could
be
the
determining
factor
see
how
tall
that
dog
is
they
are
probably
dumb
luckily
dogs
dont
discriminate
just
watch
at
a
dog
park
big
black
and
white
dogs
wag
their
tails
and
play
with
tiny
tan
dogs
a
service
dog
chases
after
the
same
ball
as
the
offduty
police
dog
so
if
dogs
dont
discriminate
then
why
do
we
the
opened
package
of
potato
chips
held
the
answer
to
the
mystery
both
detectives
looked
at
it
but
failed
to
realize
it
was
the
key
to
solve
the
crime
they
passed
by
it
assuming
it
was
random
trash
ensuring
that
the
case
would
never
be
solved
it
probably
seemed
trivial
to
most
people
but
it
mattered
to
tracey
she
wasnt
sure
why
it
mattered
so
much
to
her
but
she
understood
deep
within
her
being
that
it
mattered
to
her
so
for
the
th
day
in
a
row
tracey
sat
down
to
eat
pancakes
for
breakfast
ill
talk
to
you
tomorrow
in
more
detail
at
our
meeting
but
i
think
ive
found
a
solution
to
our
problem
its
not
exactly
legal
but
it
wont
land
us
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
either
are
you
willing
to
take
the
chance
monroe
asked
his
partner
over
the
phone
the
rain
was
coming
everyone
thought
this
would
be
a
good
thing
it
hadnt
rained
in
months
and
the
earth
was
dry
as
a
bone
it
wasnt
a
surprise
that
everyone
thought
a
good
rain
was
what
was
needed
but
they
never
expected
how
much
rain
would
actually
arrive
they
told
her
that
this
was
her
once
chance
to
show
the
world
what
she
was
made
of
she
believed
them
at
the
time
it
was
the
big
stage
and
she
knew
the
world
would
be
there
to
see
the
only
one
who
had
disagreed
with
this
sentiment
was
her
brother
he
had
told
her
that
you
dont
show
the
world
what
youre
made
of
when
they
are
all
watching
you
show
that
in
your
actions
when
nobody
was
looking
it
was
looking
more
and
more
like
her
brother
was
correct
it
was
going
to
rain
the
weather
forecast
didnt
say
that
but
the
steel
plate
in
his
hip
did
he
had
learned
over
the
years
to
trust
his
hip
over
the
weatherman
it
was
going
to
rain
so
he
better
get
outside
and
prepare
it
was
hidden
under
the
log
beside
the
stream
it
had
been
there
for
as
long
as
jerry
had
been
alive
he
wasnt
sure
if
anyone
besides
him
and
his
friends
knew
of
its
existence
he
knew
that
anyone
could
potentially
find
it
but
it
was
well
enough
hidden
that
it
seemed
unlikely
to
happen
the
fact
that
it
had
been
there
for
more
than
years
attested
to
this
so
it
was
quite
a
surprise
when
he
found
the
item
was
missing
there
were
about
twenty
people
on
the
dam
most
of
them
were
simply
walking
and
getting
exercise
there
were
a
few
who
were
fishing
there
was
a
family
who
had
laid
down
a
blanket
and
they
were
having
a
picnic
it
was
like
this
most
days
and
nothing
seemed
out
of
the
ordinary
the
problem
was
that
nobody
noticed
the
water
leaking
through
the
dam
wall
the
leather
jacked
showed
the
scars
of
being
his
favorite
for
years
it
wore
those
scars
with
pride
feeling
that
they
enhanced
his
presence
rather
than
diminishing
it
the
scars
gave
it
character
and
had
not
overwhelmed
to
the
point
that
it
had
become
ratty
the
jacket
was
in
its
prime
and
it
knew
it
he
hid
under
the
covers
hoping
that
nobody
would
notice
him
there
it
really
didnt
make
much
sense
since
it
would
be
obvious
to
anyone
who
walked
into
the
room
there
was
someone
hiding
there
but
he
still
held
out
hope
he
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
hall
and
stop
in
front
in
front
of
the
bedroom
door
he
heard
the
squeak
of
the
door
hinges
and
someone
opened
the
bedroom
door
he
held
his
breath
waiting
for
whoever
was
about
to
discover
him
but
they
never
did
do
you
really
listen
when
you
are
talking
with
someone
i
have
a
friend
who
listens
in
an
unforgiving
way
she
actually
takes
every
word
you
say
as
being
something
important
and
when
you
have
a
friend
that
listens
like
that
words
take
on
a
whole
new
meaning
ive
rented
a
car
in
las
vegas
and
have
reserved
a
hotel
in
twentynine
palms
which
is
just
north
of
joshua
tree
well
drive
from
las
vegas
through
mojave
national
preserve
and
possibly
do
a
short
hike
on
our
way
down
then
spend
all
day
on
monday
at
joshua
tree
we
can
decide
the
next
morning
if
we
want
to
do
more
in
joshua
tree
or
mojave
before
we
head
back
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
he
couldnt
give
her
a
good
explanation
about
what
had
happened
it
didnt
even
really
make
sense
to
him
all
he
knew
was
that
he
froze
at
the
moment
and
no
matter
how
hard
he
tried
to
react
nothing
in
his
body
allowed
him
to
move
it
was
as
if
he
had
instantly
become
a
statue
and
although
he
could
see
what
was
taking
place
he
couldnt
move
to
intervene
he
knew
that
wasnt
a
satisfactory
explanation
even
though
it
was
the
truth
the
paper
was
blank
it
shouldnt
have
been
there
should
have
been
writing
on
the
paper
at
least
a
paragraph
if
not
more
the
fact
that
the
writing
wasnt
there
was
frustrating
actually
it
was
even
more
than
frustrating
it
was
downright
distressing
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
the
deed
had
already
been
done
and
there
was
no
going
back
it
now
had
been
become
a
question
of
how
they
were
going
to
be
able
to
get
out
of
this
situation
and
escape
it
all
started
with
the
computer
had
he
known
what
was
to
follow
he
would
have
never
logged
on
that
day
but
the
truth
was
there
was
no
way
to
know
what
was
about
to
happen
so
dave
pressed
the
start
button
the
computer
booted
up
the
screen
came
alive
and
everything
dave
knew
to
be
true
no
longer
was
shes
asked
the
question
so
many
times
that
she
barely
listened
to
the
answers
anymore
the
answers
were
always
the
same
well
not
exactly
the
same
but
the
same
in
a
general
sense
a
more
accurate
description
was
the
answers
never
surprised
her
so
she
asked
for
the
th
time
whats
your
favorite
animal
but
this
time
was
different
when
she
heard
the
young
boys
answer
she
wondered
if
she
had
heard
him
correctly
there
was
a
time
and
a
place
for
stephanie
to
use
her
magic
the
problem
was
that
she
had
a
difficult
time
determining
this
she
wished
she
could
simply
use
it
when
the
desire
hit
and
there
wouldnt
be
any
unforeseen
consequences
unfortunately
thats
not
how
it
worked
and
the
consequences
could
be
devastating
if
she
accidentally
used
her
magic
at
the
wrong
time
the
lone
lamp
post
of
the
onestreet
town
flickered
not
quite
dead
but
definitely
on
its
way
out
suitcase
by
her
side
she
paid
no
heed
to
the
light
the
street
or
the
town
a
car
was
coming
down
the
street
and
with
her
arm
outstretched
and
thumb
in
the
air
she
had
a
plan
it
was
a
simple
tip
of
the
hat
grace
didnt
think
that
anyone
else
besides
her
had
even
noticed
it
it
wasnt
anything
that
the
average
person
would
notice
let
alone
remember
at
the
end
of
the
day
thats
why
it
seemed
so
unbelievable
that
this
little
gesture
would
ultimately
change
the
course
of
the
world
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
rest
of
her
life
this
wasnt
the
day
she
was
actually
born
but
she
knew
that
nothing
would
be
the
same
from
this
day
forward
although
this
was
a
bit
scary
to
her
it
was
also
extremely
freeing
her
past
was
no
longer
a
burden
or
something
that
she
needed
to
be
concerned
about
and
defend
she
threw
off
the
covers
keeping
her
warm
in
bed
placed
her
feet
over
the
side
of
the
bed
slipped
on
her
slipper
and
took
the
first
step
of
the
first
day
of
her
new
life
sometimes
thats
just
the
way
it
has
to
be
sure
there
were
probably
other
options
but
he
didnt
let
them
enter
his
mind
it
was
done
and
that
was
that
it
was
just
the
way
it
had
to
be
he
wondered
if
he
should
disclose
the
truth
to
his
friends
it
would
be
a
risky
move
yes
the
truth
would
make
things
a
lot
easier
if
they
all
stayed
on
the
same
page
but
the
truth
might
fracture
the
group
leaving
everything
in
even
more
of
a
mess
than
it
was
not
telling
the
truth
it
was
time
to
decide
which
way
to
go
the
boxed
moved
that
was
a
problem
peter
had
packed
the
box
three
hours
before
and
there
was
nothing
inside
that
should
make
it
move
the
question
now
was
whether
or
not
peter
was
going
to
open
it
up
and
look
inside
to
see
why
it
had
moved
the
answer
to
that
question
was
obvious
peter
dropped
the
package
into
the
mailbox
so
he
would
never
have
to
see
it
again
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
he
could
do
at
that
moment
he
played
the
situation
again
and
again
in
his
head
looking
at
what
he
might
have
done
differently
to
make
the
situation
better
no
matter
how
many
times
he
relived
the
situation
in
his
head
there
was
never
really
a
good
alternative
course
of
action
there
simply
wasnt
a
whole
lot
he
could
have
done
in
that
particular
moment
he
couldnt
remember
exactly
where
he
had
read
it
but
he
was
sure
that
he
had
the
fact
that
she
didnt
believe
him
was
quite
frustrating
as
he
began
to
search
the
internet
to
find
the
article
it
wasnt
as
if
it
was
something
that
seemed
impossible
yet
she
insisted
on
always
seeing
the
source
whenever
he
stated
a
fact
she
didnt
like
the
food
she
never
did
she
made
the
usual
complaints
and
started
the
tantrum
he
knew
was
coming
but
this
time
was
different
instead
of
trying
to
placate
her
and
her
unreasonable
demands
he
just
stared
at
her
and
watched
her
meltdown
without
saying
a
word
he
collected
the
plastic
trash
on
a
daily
basis
it
never
seemed
to
end
even
if
he
cleaned
the
entire
beach
more
plastic
would
cover
it
the
next
day
after
the
tide
had
come
in
although
it
was
a
futile
effort
that
would
never
be
done
he
continued
to
pick
up
the
trash
each
day
what
if
dogs
were
racist
would
they
care
about
fur
color
son
only
play
with
other
tan
dogs
or
maybe
it
would
depend
on
breed
honey
only
play
with
other
german
shepards
never
poodles
better
yet
it
could
depend
on
occupation
im
a
sled
dog
while
youre
only
a
running
companion
leave
me
alone
maybe
the
neighborhood
they
live
in
could
be
the
way
they
choose
which
dogs
to
associate
with
and
which
to
shun
size
could
be
the
determining
factor
see
how
tall
that
dog
is
they
are
probably
dumb
luckily
dogs
dont
discriminate
just
watch
at
a
dog
park
big
black
and
white
dogs
wag
their
tails
and
play
with
tiny
tan
dogs
a
service
dog
chases
after
the
same
ball
as
the
offduty
police
dog
so
if
dogs
dont
discriminate
then
why
do
we
the
shoes
had
been
there
for
as
long
as
anyone
could
remember
in
fact
it
was
difficult
for
anyone
to
come
up
with
a
date
they
had
first
appeared
it
had
seemed
theyd
always
been
there
and
yet
they
seemed
so
out
of
place
why
nobody
had
removed
them
was
a
question
that
had
been
asked
time
and
again
but
while
they
all
thought
it
nobody
had
ever
found
the
energy
to
actually
do
it
so
the
shoes
remained
on
the
steps
out
of
place
in
one
sense
but
perfectly
normal
in
another
debbie
put
her
hand
into
the
hole
sliding
her
hand
down
as
far
as
her
arm
could
reach
she
wiggled
her
fingers
hoping
to
touch
something
but
all
she
felt
was
air
she
shifted
the
weight
of
her
body
to
try
and
reach
an
inch
or
two
more
down
the
hole
her
fingers
still
touched
nothing
but
air
green
vines
attached
to
the
trunk
of
the
tree
had
wound
themselves
toward
the
top
of
the
canopy
ants
used
the
vine
as
their
private
highway
avoiding
all
the
creases
and
crags
of
the
bark
to
freely
move
at
top
speed
from
top
to
bottom
or
bottom
to
top
depending
on
their
current
chore
at
least
this
was
the
way
it
was
supposed
to
be
something
had
damaged
the
vine
overnight
halfway
up
the
tree
leaving
a
gap
in
the
once
pristine
ant
highway
at
that
moment
she
realized
that
she
had
created
her
current
life
it
wasnt
the
life
she
wanted
but
she
took
responsibility
for
how
it
currently
stood
something
clicked
and
she
saw
that
every
choice
she
made
to
this
point
in
her
life
had
led
to
where
her
life
stood
at
this
very
moment
even
if
she
knew
this
wasnt
where
she
wanted
to
be
she
determined
to
choose
to
change
it
the
thing
thats
great
about
this
job
is
the
time
sourcing
the
items
involves
no
traveling
i
just
look
online
to
buy
it
its
really
as
simple
as
that
while
everyone
else
is
searching
for
what
they
can
sell
i
sit
in
front
of
my
computer
and
buy
better
stuff
for
less
money
and
spend
a
fraction
of
the
time
doing
it
finding
the
truth
wouldnt
be
easy
thats
for
sure
then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth
thats
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most
it
wasnt
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found
there
were
two
things
that
were
important
to
tracey
the
first
was
her
dog
anyone
that
had
ever
met
tracey
knew
how
much
she
loved
her
dog
most
would
say
that
she
treated
it
as
her
child
the
dog
went
everywhere
with
her
and
it
had
been
her
best
friend
for
the
past
five
years
the
second
thing
that
was
important
to
tracey
however
would
be
a
lot
more
surprising
to
most
people
balloons
are
pretty
and
come
in
different
colors
different
shapes
different
sizes
and
they
can
even
adjust
sizes
as
needed
but
dont
make
them
too
big
or
they
might
just
pop
and
then
byebye
balloon
itll
be
gone
and
lost
for
the
rest
of
mankind
they
can
serve
a
variety
of
purposes
from
decorating
to
water
balloon
wars
you
just
have
to
use
your
head
to
think
a
little
bit
about
what
to
do
with
them
there
was
a
reason
for
her
shyness
everyone
assumed
it
had
always
been
there
but
she
knew
better
she
knew
the
exact
moment
that
the
shyness
began
it
had
been
that
fateful
moment
at
the
lake
there
are
just
some
events
that
do
that
to
you
betty
decided
to
write
a
short
story
and
she
was
sure
it
was
going
to
be
amazing
she
had
already
written
it
in
her
head
and
each
time
she
thought
about
it
she
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
knowing
how
wonderful
it
would
be
she
could
imagine
the
accolades
coming
in
and
the
praise
she
would
receive
for
creating
such
a
wonderful
piece
she
was
therefore
extremely
frustrated
when
she
actually
sat
down
to
write
the
short
story
and
the
story
that
was
so
beautiful
inside
her
head
refused
to
come
out
that
way
on
paper
he
wandered
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
basement
the
damp
musty
smell
of
unuse
hung
in
the
air
a
single
small
window
let
in
a
glimmer
of
light
but
this
simply
made
the
shadows
in
the
basement
deeper
he
inhaled
deeply
and
looked
around
at
a
mess
that
had
been
accumulating
for
over
years
he
was
positive
that
this
was
the
place
he
wanted
to
live
a
long
black
shadow
slid
across
the
pavement
near
their
feet
and
the
five
venusians
very
much
startled
looked
overhead
they
were
barely
in
time
to
see
the
huge
gray
form
of
the
carnivore
before
it
vanished
behind
a
sign
atop
a
nearby
building
which
bore
the
mystifying
information
pepsicola
breastfeeding
is
good
for
babies
and
moms
infants
that
are
breastfed
get
antibodies
from
their
mothers
against
common
illnesses
breastfed
babies
have
less
chance
of
being
obese
as
an
adult
breastfeeding
a
baby
lets
the
infantmother
pair
bond
in
a
very
unique
way
mothers
who
breastfeed
lower
their
chances
of
developing
breast
cancer
usually
mothers
who
breastfeed
lose
their
pregnancy
weight
more
quickly
and
easily
the
benefits
of
breastfeeding
are
numerous
another
option
you
have
is
choosing
the
number
of
syllables
in
the
words
you
speak
you
probably
have
never
considered
this
option
before
but
you
have
it
every
time
you
open
your
mouth
and
speak
you
make
so
many
choices
like
this
that
you
never
even
think
about
but
you
have
the
choice
with
each
one
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
knowledge
the
river
slowly
meandered
through
the
open
space
it
had
hidden
secrets
that
it
didnt
want
to
reveal
it
had
a
wellplanned
strategy
to
appear
calm
inviting
and
appealing
thats
how
the
river
lured
her
unknowing
victims
to
her
waters
edge
the
time
had
come
for
nancy
to
say
goodbye
she
had
been
dreading
this
moment
for
a
good
six
months
and
it
had
finally
arrived
despite
her
best
efforts
to
forestall
it
no
matter
how
hard
she
tried
she
couldnt
keep
the
inevitable
from
happening
so
the
time
had
come
for
a
normal
person
to
say
goodbye
and
move
on
it
was
at
this
moment
that
nancy
decided
not
to
be
a
normal
person
after
all
the
time
and
effort
she
had
expended
she
couldnt
bring
herself
to
do
it
debbie
knew
she
was
being
selfish
and
unreasonable
she
understood
why
the
others
in
the
room
were
angry
and
frustrated
with
her
and
the
way
she
was
acting
in
her
eyes
it
didnt
really
matter
how
they
felt
because
she
simply
didnt
care
are
you
getting
my
texts
she
texted
to
him
he
glanced
at
it
and
chuckled
under
his
breath
of
course
he
was
getting
them
but
if
he
wasnt
getting
them
how
would
he
ever
be
able
to
answer
he
put
the
phone
down
and
continued
on
his
project
he
was
ignoring
her
texts
and
he
planned
to
continue
to
do
so
it
had
become
a
far
too
common
an
event
in
her
life
she
has
specifically
placed
the
key
to
the
box
in
a
special
place
so
that
she
wouldnt
lose
it
and
know
exactly
where
it
was
when
the
key
was
needed
now
that
she
needed
to
open
the
box
she
had
absolutely
no
idea
where
that
special
spot
she
placed
the
key
might
be
there
was
only
one
way
to
do
things
in
the
statton
house
that
one
way
was
to
do
exactly
what
the
father
charlie
demanded
he
made
the
decisions
and
everyone
else
followed
without
question
that
was
until
today
she
tried
to
explain
that
love
wasnt
like
pie
there
wasnt
a
set
number
of
slices
to
be
given
out
there
wasnt
less
to
be
given
to
one
person
if
you
wanted
to
give
more
to
another
that
after
a
set
amount
was
given
out
it
would
all
disappear
she
tried
to
explain
this
but
it
fell
on
deaf
ears
he
had
done
everything
right
there
had
been
no
mistakes
throughout
the
entire
process
it
had
been
perfection
and
he
knew
it
without
a
doubt
but
the
results
still
stared
back
at
him
with
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
my
pincher
collar
is
snapped
on
then
comes
the
electric
zapper
collar
finally
my
purple
athome
collar
is
taken
off
and
i
know
im
going
for
a
walk
to
the
dog
park
im
so
excited
to
see
my
friends
i
hope
spike
or
thunder
are
there
already
theyre
the
most
fun
to
chase
and
tumble
with
my
human
is
pretty
strict
with
me
im
only
allowed
on
the
grass
and
not
on
the
sidewalks
i
think
shes
afraid
im
going
to
jump
on
the
other
humans
i
dont
understand
why
everyone
else
gets
to
jump
on
the
benches
and
run
wild
on
the
sidewalks
they
dont
listen
to
their
humans
i
know
i
could
ignore
mine
but
if
i
do
she
may
zap
me
and
its
just
not
worth
it
she
probably
wouldnt
let
me
back
at
the
dog
park
if
i
didnt
listen
to
her
i
just
love
the
dog
park
it
really
shouldnt
have
mattered
to
betty
thats
what
she
kept
trying
to
convince
herself
even
if
she
knew
it
mattered
to
betty
more
than
practically
anything
else
why
was
she
trying
to
convince
herself
otherwise
as
she
stepped
forward
to
knock
on
bettys
door
she
still
didnt
have
a
convincing
answer
to
this
question
that
shed
been
asking
herself
for
more
than
two
years
now
what
is
the
best
way
to
get
what
you
want
she
asked
he
looked
down
at
the
ground
knowing
that
she
wouldnt
like
his
answer
he
hesitated
knowing
that
the
truth
would
only
hurt
how
was
he
going
to
tell
her
that
the
best
way
for
him
to
get
what
he
wanted
was
to
leave
her
dave
wasnt
exactly
sure
how
he
had
ended
up
in
this
predicament
he
ran
through
all
the
events
that
had
lead
to
this
current
situation
and
it
still
didnt
make
sense
he
wanted
to
spend
some
time
to
try
and
make
sense
of
it
all
but
he
had
higher
priorities
at
the
moment
the
first
was
how
to
get
out
of
his
current
situation
of
being
naked
in
a
tree
with
snow
falling
all
around
and
no
way
for
him
to
get
down
sitting
in
the
sun
away
from
everyone
who
had
done
him
harm
in
the
past
he
quietly
listened
to
those
who
roamed
by
he
felt
at
peace
in
the
moment
hoping
it
would
last
but
knowing
the
reprieve
would
soon
come
to
an
end
he
closed
his
eyes
the
sun
beating
down
on
face
and
he
smiled
he
smiled
for
the
first
time
in
as
long
as
he
could
remember
it
was
cloudy
outside
but
not
really
raining
there
was
a
light
sprinkle
at
most
and
there
certainly
wasnt
a
need
for
an
umbrella
this
hadnt
stopped
sarah
from
pulling
her
umbrella
out
and
opening
it
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
weather
or
the
potential
rain
later
that
day
sarah
used
the
umbrella
to
hide
there
was
a
time
when
this
wouldnt
have
bothered
her
the
fact
that
it
did
actually
bother
her
bothered
her
even
more
what
had
changed
in
her
life
that
such
a
small
thing
could
annoy
her
so
much
for
the
entire
day
she
knew
it
was
ridiculous
that
she
even
took
notice
of
it
yet
she
was
still
obsessing
over
it
as
she
tried
to
fall
asleep
ill
talk
to
you
tomorrow
in
more
detail
at
our
meeting
but
i
think
ive
found
a
solution
to
our
problem
its
not
exactly
legal
but
it
wont
land
us
in
jail
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
either
are
you
willing
to
take
the
chance
monroe
asked
his
partner
over
the
phone
ive
rented
a
car
in
las
vegas
and
have
reserved
a
hotel
in
twentynine
palms
which
is
just
north
of
joshua
tree
well
drive
from
las
vegas
through
mojave
national
preserve
and
possibly
do
a
short
hike
on
our
way
down
then
spend
all
day
on
monday
at
joshua
tree
we
can
decide
the
next
morning
if
we
want
to
do
more
in
joshua
tree
or
mojave
before
we
head
back
its
never
good
to
give
them
details
janice
told
her
sister
always
be
a
little
vague
and
keep
them
guessing
her
sister
listened
intently
and
nodded
in
agreement
she
didnt
fully
understand
what
her
sister
was
saying
but
that
didnt
matter
she
loved
her
so
much
that
she
would
have
agreed
to
whatever
came
out
of
her
mouth
i
checked
in
for
the
night
at
out
o
the
way
motel
what
a
bad
choice
that
was
first
i
took
a
shower
and
a
spider
crawled
out
of
the
drain
next
the
towel
rack
fell
down
when
i
reached
for
the
one
small
bath
towel
this
allowed
the
towel
to
fall
halfway
into
the
toilet
i
tried
to
watch
a
movie
but
the
remote
control
was
sticky
and
wouldnt
stop
scrolling
through
the
channels
i
gave
up
for
the
night
and
crawled
into
bed
i
stretched
out
my
leg
and
felt
something
furry
by
my
foot
filled
with
fear
i
reached
down
and
to
my
surprise
i
pulled
out
a
raccoon
skin
pair
of
underwear
after
my
initial
relief
that
it
wasnt
alive
the
image
of
a
fat
ugly
businessman
wearing
raccoon
skin
briefs
filled
my
brain
i
jumped
out
of
the
bed
threw
my
toothbrush
into
my
bag
and
sprinted
towards
my
car
the
time
to
take
action
was
now
all
three
men
knew
in
their
hearts
this
was
the
case
yet
none
of
them
moved
a
muscle
to
try
they
were
all
watching
and
waiting
for
one
of
the
others
to
make
the
first
move
so
they
could
follow
a
step
or
two
behind
and
help
the
situation
demanded
a
leader
and
all
three
men
were
followers
finding
the
truth
wouldnt
be
easy
thats
for
sure
then
there
was
the
question
of
whether
or
not
jane
really
wanted
to
know
the
truth
thats
the
thing
that
bothered
her
most
it
wasnt
the
difficulty
of
actually
finding
out
what
happened
that
was
the
obstacle
but
having
to
live
with
that
information
once
it
was
found
the
paper
was
blank
it
shouldnt
have
been
there
should
have
been
writing
on
the
paper
at
least
a
paragraph
if
not
more
the
fact
that
the
writing
wasnt
there
was
frustrating
actually
it
was
even
more
than
frustrating
it
was
downright
distressing
the
computer
wouldnt
start
she
banged
on
the
side
and
tried
again
nothing
she
lifted
it
up
and
dropped
it
to
the
table
still
nothing
she
banged
her
closed
fist
against
the
top
it
was
at
this
moment
she
saw
the
irony
of
trying
to
fix
the
machine
with
violence
housework
could
be
everyones
work
not
just
womens
work
why
do
women
enable
men
to
act
oblivious
to
cleaning
grocery
shopping
pet
feeding
etc
somehow
when
men
live
alone
they
figure
out
how
to
do
all
of
those
things
all
on
their
own
my
friends
husband
claimed
he
didnt
know
that
sheets
should
be
washed
more
than
once
a
season
he
said
he
didnt
know
one
had
to
clean
toilets
he
assumed
that
since
you
flush
toilets
they
clean
themselves
she
tried
to
get
him
to
help
but
he
did
an
awful
job
so
she
let
him
off
the
hook
wouldnt
it
be
better
if
she
spent
the
time
and
energy
to
get
him
to
do
it
right
instead
of
letting
him
claim
he
is
just
bad
at
it
my
sons
were
raised
to
clean
toilets
and
change
their
own
sheets
hopefully
in
their
future
homes
the
housework
will
be
equally
divided
puppies
are
soft
cute
funny
and
make
a
big
mess
every
month
or
two
our
family
fosters
week
old
puppies
for
a
puppy
rescue
nonprofit
organization
we
all
enjoy
cuddling
their
furry
bodies
after
a
clean
bath
fresh
puppy
smell
is
great
the
puppies
play
with
each
other
and
our
adult
dog
they
look
so
funny
when
they
lay
on
top
of
each
other
and
sleep
while
puppies
can
be
great
fun
they
also
can
make
big
messes
puppies
can
make
a
lot
of
puppy
pee
and
poop
its
a
challenge
to
keep
the
puppies
and
the
puppy
pen
clean
it
wasnt
quite
yet
time
to
panic
there
was
still
time
to
salvage
the
situation
at
least
that
is
what
she
was
telling
himself
the
reality
was
that
it
was
time
to
panic
and
there
wasnt
time
to
salvage
the
situation
but
he
continued
to
delude
himself
into
believing
there
was
brock
would
have
never
dared
to
do
it
on
his
own
he
thought
to
himself
that
is
why
kenneth
and
he
had
become
such
good
friends
kenneth
forced
brock
out
of
his
comfort
zone
and
made
him
try
new
things
hed
never
imagine
doing
otherwise
up
to
this
point
this
had
been
a
good
thing
it
had
expanded
brocks
experiences
and
given
him
a
new
appreciation
for
life
now
that
both
of
them
were
in
the
back
of
a
police
car
all
brock
could
think
was
that
he
would
have
never
dared
do
it
except
for
the
influence
of
kenneth
trees
it
was
something
about
the
trees
the
way
they
swayed
with
the
wind
in
unison
the
way
they
shaded
the
area
around
them
the
sounds
of
their
leaves
in
the
wind
and
the
creaks
from
the
branches
as
they
sway
the
trees
were
making
a
statement
that
i
just
couldnt
understand
begin
today
thats
all
the
note
said
there
was
no
indication
from
where
it
came
or
who
may
have
written
it
had
it
been
meant
for
someone
else
meghan
looked
around
the
room
but
nobody
made
eye
contact
back
for
a
brief
moment
she
thought
it
might
be
a
message
for
her
to
follow
her
dreams
but
ultimately
decided
it
was
easier
to
ignore
it
as
she
crumpled
it
up
and
threw
it
away
many
people
say
that
life
isnt
like
a
bed
of
roses
i
beg
to
differ
i
think
that
life
is
quite
like
a
bed
of
roses
just
like
life
a
bed
of
roses
looks
pretty
on
the
outside
but
when
youre
in
it
you
find
that
it
is
nothing
but
thorns
and
pain
i
myself
have
been
pricked
quite
badly
there
were
only
two
ways
to
get
out
of
this
mess
if
they
all
worked
together
the
problem
was
that
neither
was
all
that
appealing
one
would
likely
cause
everyone
a
huge
amount
of
physical
pain
while
the
other
would
likely
end
up
with
everyone
in
jail
in
sams
mind
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
he
threw
everyone
else
under
the
bus
and
he
secretly
sprinted
away
leaving
the
others
to
take
the
fall
without
him
the
red
line
moved
across
the
page
with
each
millimeter
it
advanced
forward
something
changed
in
the
room
the
actual
change
taking
place
was
difficult
to
perceive
but
the
change
was
real
the
red
line
continued
relentlessly
across
the
page
and
the
room
would
never
be
the
same
welcome
to
my
world
you
will
be
greeted
by
the
unexpected
here
and
your
mind
will
be
challenged
and
expanded
in
ways
that
you
never
thought
possible
that
is
if
you
are
able
to
survive
explain
to
me
again
why
i
shouldnt
cheat
he
asked
all
the
others
do
and
nobody
ever
gets
punished
for
doing
so
i
should
go
about
being
happy
losing
to
cheaters
because
i
know
that
i
dont
thats
what
youre
telling
me
dave
watched
as
the
forest
burned
up
on
the
hill
only
a
few
miles
from
her
house
the
car
had
been
hastily
packed
and
marta
was
inside
trying
to
round
up
the
last
of
the
pets
dave
went
through
his
mental
list
of
the
most
important
papers
and
documents
that
they
couldnt
leave
behind
he
scolded
himself
for
not
having
prepared
these
better
in
advance
and
hoped
that
he
had
remembered
everything
that
was
needed
he
continued
to
wait
for
marta
to
appear
with
the
pets
but
she
still
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
could
tell
a
lot
about
a
person
by
their
ears
the
way
they
stuck
out
and
the
size
of
the
earlobes
could
give
you
wonderful
insights
into
the
person
of
course
she
couldnt
scientifically
prove
any
of
this
but
that
didnt
matter
to
her
before
anything
else
she
would
size
up
the
ears
of
the
person
she
was
talking
to
she
sat
down
with
her
notebook
in
her
hand
her
mind
wandering
to
faraway
places
she
paused
and
considered
all
that
had
happened
it
hadnt
gone
as
expected
when
the
day
began
she
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
bad
one
but
as
she
sat
recalling
the
days
events
to
write
them
down
she
had
to
admit
it
had
been
a
rather
marvelous
day
it
had
been
her
dream
for
years
but
dana
had
failed
to
take
any
action
toward
making
it
come
true
there
had
always
been
a
good
excuse
to
delay
or
prioritize
another
project
as
she
woke
she
realized
she
was
once
again
at
a
crossroads
would
it
be
another
excuse
or
would
she
finally
find
the
courage
to
pursue
her
dream
dana
rose
and
took
her
first
step
it
was
a
weird
concept
why
would
i
really
need
to
generate
a
random
paragraph
could
i
actually
learn
something
from
doing
so
all
these
questions
were
running
through
her
head
as
she
pressed
the
generate
button
to
her
surprise
she
found
what
she
least
expected
to
see
sometimes
its
the
first
moment
of
the
day
that
catches
you
off
guard
thats
what
wendy
was
thinking
she
opened
her
window
to
see
fire
engines
screeching
down
the
street
while
this
wasnt
something
completely
unheard
of
it
also
wasnt
normal
it
was
a
sure
sign
of
what
was
going
to
happen
that
day
she
could
feel
it
in
her
bones
and
it
wasnt
the
way
she
wanted
the
day
to
begin
i
love
the
feel
of
wood
curls
flying
off
the
lathe
as
i
begin
to
shape
the
log
in
front
of
me
the
sound
of
scraping
changes
based
on
the
wetness
of
the
wood
the
speed
at
which
the
lathe
is
turning
and
the
type
of
cut
i
am
making
the
smell
and
feel
of
wet
wood
being
turned
are
unique
the
water
is
sprayed
out
as
i
cut
through
the
different
layers
of
wood
a
log
can
turn
into
anything
ones
imagination
can
think
of
with
the
right
set
of
handson
tools
i
have
those
hands
and
imagination
i
use
all
of
my
senses
and
intuition
to
create
a
beautiful
object
that
is
why
i
enjoy
turning
wood
have
you
ever
wondered
about
toes
why
toes
and
not
why
are
some
bigger
than
others
some
people
can
use
their
toes
to
pick
up
things
while
others
can
barely
move
them
on
command
some
toes
are
nice
to
look
at
while
others
are
definitely
not
something
you
want
to
look
at
toes
can
be
stubbed
and
make
us
scream
toes
help
us
balance
and
walk
toes
are
just
something
to
ponder
the
bridge
spanning
a
foot
gully
stood
in
front
of
him
as
the
last
obstacle
blocking
him
from
reaching
his
destination
while
people
may
have
called
it
a
bridge
the
reality
was
it
was
nothing
more
than
splintered
wooden
planks
held
together
by
rotting
ropes
it
was
questionable
whether
it
would
hold
the
weight
of
a
child
let
alone
the
weight
of
a
grown
man
the
problem
was
there
was
no
other
way
across
the
gully
and
this
played
into
his
calculations
of
whether
or
not
it
was
worth
the
risk
of
trying
to
cross
it
it
wasnt
supposed
to
end
that
way
the
plan
had
been
meticulously
thought
out
and
practiced
again
and
again
there
was
only
one
possible
result
once
it
had
been
implemented
but
as
they
stood
there
the
result
wasnt
anything
close
to
what
it
should
have
been
they
all
blankly
looked
at
each
wondering
how
this
could
have
happened
in
their
minds
they
all
began
to
blame
the
other
members
of
the
group
as
to
why
they
had
failed
dont
forget
that
gifts
often
come
with
costs
that
go
beyond
their
purchase
price
when
you
purchase
a
child
the
latest
smartphone
youre
also
committing
to
a
monthly
phone
bill
when
you
purchase
the
latest
gaming
system
youre
likely
not
going
to
be
satisfied
with
the
games
that
come
with
it
for
long
and
want
to
purchase
new
titles
to
play
when
you
buy
gifts
its
important
to
remember
that
some
come
with
additional
costs
down
the
road
that
can
be
much
more
expensive
than
the
initial
gift
itself
turning
away
from
the
ledge
he
started
slowly
down
the
mountain
deciding
that
he
would
that
very
night
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
the
manhouse
in
the
meantime
he
would
go
down
into
the
canyon
and
get
a
cool
drink
after
which
he
would
visit
some
berry
patches
just
over
the
ridge
and
explore
among
the
foothills
a
bit
before
his
naptime
which
always
came
just
after
the
sun
had
walked
past
the
middle
of
the
sky
at
that
period
of
the
day
the
suns
warm
rays
seemed
to
cast
a
sleepy
spell
over
the
silent
mountainside
so
all
of
the
animals
with
one
accord
had
decided
it
should
be
the
hour
for
their
midday
sleep
it
was
the
best
compliment
that
hed
ever
received
although
the
person
who
gave
it
likely
never
knew
it
had
been
an
offhand
observation
on
his
ability
to
hold
a
conversation
and
actually
add
pertinent
information
to
it
on
practically
any
topic
although
he
hadnt
consciously
strived
to
be
able
to
do
so
hed
started
to
voraciously
read
the
news
when
he
couldnt
keep
up
on
topics
his
friends
discussed
because
their
conversations
went
above
his
head
the
fact
that
someone
had
noticed
enough
to
compliment
him
that
he
could
talk
intelligently
about
many
topics
meant
that
he
had
succeeded
in
his
quest
to
be
better
informed
it
went
through
such
rapid
contortions
that
the
little
bear
was
forced
to
change
his
hold
on
it
so
many
times
he
became
confused
in
the
darkness
and
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
tell
whether
he
held
the
sheep
right
side
up
or
upside
down
but
that
point
was
decided
for
him
a
moment
later
by
the
animal
itself
who
with
a
sudden
twist
jabbed
its
horns
so
hard
into
his
lowest
ribs
that
he
gave
a
grunt
of
anger
and
disgust
she
had
been
an
angel
for
coming
up
on
years
and
in
all
that
time
nobody
had
told
her
this
was
possible
the
fact
that
it
could
ever
happen
never
even
entered
her
mind
yet
there
she
stood
with
the
undeniable
evidence
sitting
on
the
ground
before
her
angels
could
lose
their
wings
the
light
blinded
him
it
was
dark
and
he
thought
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
area
but
the
light
shining
in
his
eyes
proved
him
wrong
it
came
from
about
feet
away
and
was
shining
so
directly
into
his
eyes
he
couldnt
make
out
anything
about
the
person
holding
the
light
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
in
this
situation
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
flashlight
of
his
own
that
was
much
stronger
than
the
one
currently
blinding
him
he
turned
it
on
and
pointed
it
into
the
strangers
eyes
the
alarm
went
off
at
exactly
am
as
it
had
every
morning
for
the
past
five
years
barbara
began
her
morning
and
was
ready
to
eat
breakfast
by
am
the
day
appeared
to
be
as
normal
as
any
other
but
that
was
about
to
change
in
fact
it
was
going
to
change
at
exactly
am
indescribable
oppression
which
seemed
to
generate
in
some
unfamiliar
part
of
her
consciousness
filled
her
whole
being
with
a
vague
anguish
it
was
like
a
shadow
like
a
mist
passing
across
her
souls
summer
day
it
was
strange
and
unfamiliar
it
was
a
mood
she
did
not
sit
there
inwardly
upbraiding
her
husband
lamenting
at
fate
which
had
directed
her
footsteps
to
the
path
which
they
had
taken
she
was
just
having
a
good
cry
all
to
herself
the
mosquitoes
made
merry
over
her
biting
her
firm
round
arms
and
nipping
at
her
bare
insteps
nobody
really
understood
kevin
it
wasnt
that
he
was
super
strange
or
difficult
it
was
more
that
there
wasnt
enough
there
that
anyone
wanted
to
take
the
time
to
understand
him
this
was
a
shame
as
kevin
had
many
of
the
answers
to
the
important
questions
most
people
who
knew
him
had
it
was
even
more
of
a
shame
that
theyd
refuse
to
listen
even
if
kevin
offered
to
give
them
the
answers
so
kevin
remained
silent
misunderstood
and
kept
those
important
answers
to
life
to
himself
stormi
is
a
dog
she
is
dark
grey
and
has
long
legs
her
eyes
are
expressive
and
are
able
to
let
her
humans
know
what
she
is
thinking
her
tongue
is
long
pink
and
wet
her
long
legs
allow
her
to
sprint
after
other
dogs
people
or
bunnies
she
can
be
a
good
dog
but
also
very
bad
her
tail
wags
when
happy
or
excited
and
hides
between
her
back
legs
when
she
is
bad
stormi
is
a
dog
i
love
it
was
going
to
rain
the
weather
forecast
didnt
say
that
but
the
steel
plate
in
his
hip
did
he
had
learned
over
the
years
to
trust
his
hip
over
the
weatherman
it
was
going
to
rain
so
he
better
get
outside
and
prepare
where
do
they
get
a
random
paragraph
he
wondered
as
he
clicked
the
generate
button
do
they
just
write
a
random
paragraph
or
do
they
get
it
somewhere
at
that
moment
he
read
the
random
paragraph
and
realized
it
was
about
random
paragraphs
and
his
world
would
never
be
the
same
the
clowns
had
taken
over
and
yes
they
were
literally
clowns
over
had
appeared
out
of
a
small
vw
bug
that
had
been
driven
up
to
the
bank
now
they
were
all
inside
and
had
taken
it
over
the
trees
therefore
must
be
such
old
and
primitive
techniques
that
they
thought
nothing
of
them
deeming
them
so
inconsequential
that
even
savages
like
us
would
know
of
them
and
not
be
suspicious
at
that
they
probably
didnt
have
too
much
time
after
they
detected
us
orbiting
and
intending
to
land
and
if
that
were
true
there
could
be
only
one
place
where
their
civilization
was
hidden
the
boy
walked
down
the
street
in
a
carefree
way
playing
without
notice
of
what
was
about
him
he
didnt
hear
the
sound
of
the
car
as
his
ball
careened
into
the
road
he
took
a
step
toward
it
and
in
doing
so
sealed
his
fate
it
was
a
simple
tip
of
the
hat
grace
didnt
think
that
anyone
else
besides
her
had
even
noticed
it
it
wasnt
anything
that
the
average
person
would
notice
let
alone
remember
at
the
end
of
the
day
thats
why
it
seemed
so
unbelievable
that
this
little
gesture
would
ultimately
change
the
course
of
the
world
it
really
shouldnt
have
mattered
to
betty
thats
what
she
kept
trying
to
convince
herself
even
if
she
knew
it
mattered
to
betty
more
than
practically
anything
else
why
was
she
trying
to
convince
herself
otherwise
as
she
stepped
forward
to
knock
on
bettys
door
she
still
didnt
have
a
convincing
answer
to
this
question
that
shed
been
asking
herself
for
more
than
two
years
now
it
was
cloudy
outside
but
not
really
raining
there
was
a
light
sprinkle
at
most
and
there
certainly
wasnt
a
need
for
an
umbrella
this
hadnt
stopped
sarah
from
pulling
her
umbrella
out
and
opening
it
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
weather
or
the
potential
rain
later
that
day
sarah
used
the
umbrella
to
hide
twentyfive
years
dana
had
been
waiting
she
tried
to
be
patient
during
that
time
but
she
hadnt
always
managed
to
be
as
patient
as
shed
like
but
today
the
opportunity
had
finally
come
the
thing
she
always
imagined
would
make
her
the
happiest
person
in
the
world
was
about
to
happen
she
didnt
know
why
at
this
specific
time
she
all
of
a
sudden
felt
sick
inside
there
was
something
beautiful
in
his
hate
it
wasnt
the
hate
itself
as
it
was
a
disgusting
display
of
racism
and
intolerance
it
was
what
propelled
the
hate
and
the
fact
that
although
he
had
this
hate
he
didnt
understand
where
it
came
from
it
was
at
that
moment
that
she
realized
that
there
was
hope
in
changing
him
dragons
dont
exist
they
said
they
are
the
stuff
of
legend
and
peoples
imagination
greg
would
have
agreed
with
this
assessment
without
a
second
thought
hours
ago
but
now
that
there
was
a
dragon
staring
directly
into
his
eyes
he
questioned
everything
that
he
had
been
told
dave
found
joy
in
the
daily
routine
of
life
he
awoke
at
the
same
time
ate
the
same
breakfast
and
drove
the
same
commute
he
worked
at
a
job
that
never
seemed
to
change
and
he
got
home
at
pm
sharp
every
night
it
was
who
he
had
been
for
the
last
ten
years
and
he
had
no
idea
that
was
all
about
to
change
she
counted
one
she
could
hear
the
steps
coming
closer
two
puffs
of
breath
could
be
seen
coming
from
his
mouth
three
he
stopped
beside
her
four
she
pulled
the
trigger
of
the
gun
the
red
ball
sat
proudly
at
the
top
of
the
toybox
it
had
been
the
last
to
be
played
with
and
anticipated
it
would
be
the
next
as
well
the
other
toys
grumbled
beneath
at
one
time
each
had
held
the
spot
of
the
red
ball
but
over
time
they
had
sunk
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
toy
box
he
took
a
sip
of
the
drink
he
wasnt
sure
whether
he
liked
it
or
not
but
at
this
moment
it
didnt
matter
she
had
made
it
especially
for
him
so
he
would
have
forced
it
down
even
if
he
had
absolutely
hated
it
thats
simply
the
way
things
worked
she
made
him
a
newfangled
drink
each
day
and
he
took
a
sip
of
it
and
smiled
saying
it
was
excellent
it
was
cloudy
outside
but
not
really
raining
there
was
a
light
sprinkle
at
most
and
there
certainly
wasnt
a
need
for
an
umbrella
this
hadnt
stopped
sarah
from
pulling
her
umbrella
out
and
opening
it
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
weather
or
the
potential
rain
later
that
day
sarah
used
the
umbrella
to
hide
she
didnt
like
the
food
she
never
did
she
made
the
usual
complaints
and
started
the
tantrum
he
knew
was
coming
but
this
time
was
different
instead
of
trying
to
placate
her
and
her
unreasonable
demands
he
just
stared
at
her
and
watched
her
meltdown
without
saying
a
word
it
was
a
concerning
development
that
he
couldnt
get
out
of
his
mind
hed
had
many
friends
throughout
his
early
years
and
had
fond
memories
of
playing
with
them
but
he
couldnt
understand
how
it
had
all
stopped
there
was
some
point
as
he
grew
up
that
he
played
with
each
of
his
friends
for
the
very
last
time
and
he
had
no
idea
that
it
would
be
the
last
sometimes
its
just
better
not
to
be
seen
thats
how
harry
had
always
lived
his
life
he
prided
himself
as
being
the
fly
on
the
wall
and
the
fae
that
blended
into
the
crowd
thats
why
he
was
so
shocked
that
she
noticed
him
matt
told
her
to
reach
for
the
stars
but
veronica
thought
it
was
the
most
ridiculous
advice
shed
ever
received
sure
it
had
been
wellmeaning
when
he
said
it
but
she
didnt
understand
why
anyone
would
want
to
suggest
something
that
would
literally
kill
you
if
you
actually
managed
to
achieve
it
twentyfive
hours
had
passed
since
the
incident
it
seemed
to
be
a
lot
longer
than
that
that
twentyfive
hours
seemed
more
like
a
week
in
her
mind
the
fact
that
she
still
was
having
trouble
comprehending
exactly
what
took
place
wasnt
helping
the
matter
she
thought
if
she
could
just
get
a
little
rest
the
entire
incident
might
make
a
little
more
sense
what
if
dogs
were
racist
would
they
care
about
fur
color
son
only
play
with
other
tan
dogs
or
maybe
it
would
depend
on
breed
honey
only
play
with
other
german
shepards
never
poodles
better
yet
it
could
depend
on
occupation
im
a
sled
dog
while
youre
only
a
running
companion
leave
me
alone
maybe
the
neighborhood
they
live
in
could
be
the
way
they
choose
which
dogs
to
associate
with
and
which
to
shun
size
could
be
the
determining
factor
see
how
tall
that
dog
is
they
are
probably
dumb
luckily
dogs
dont
discriminate
just
watch
at
a
dog
park
big
black
and
white
dogs
wag
their
tails
and
play
with
tiny
tan
dogs
a
service
dog
chases
after
the
same
ball
as
the
offduty
police
dog
so
if
dogs
dont
discriminate
then
why
do
we
it
seemed
like
it
should
have
been
so
simple
there
was
nothing
inherently
difficult
with
getting
the
project
done
it
was
simple
and
straightforward
enough
that
even
a
child
should
have
been
able
to
complete
it
on
time
but
that
wasnt
the
case
the
deadline
had
arrived
and
the
project
remained
unfinished
at
that
moment
she
realized
that
she
had
created
her
current
life
it
wasnt
the
life
she
wanted
but
she
took
responsibility
for
how
it
currently
stood
something
clicked
and
she
saw
that
every
choice
she
made
to
this
point
in
her
life
had
led
to
where
her
life
stood
at
this
very
moment
even
if
she
knew
this
wasnt
where
she
wanted
to
be
she
determined
to
choose
to
change
it
sometimes
thats
just
the
way
it
has
to
be
sure
there
were
probably
other
options
but
he
didnt
let
them
enter
his
mind
it
was
done
and
that
was
that
it
was
just
the
way
it
had
to
be
balloons
are
pretty
and
come
in
different
colors
different
shapes
different
sizes
and
they
can
even
adjust
sizes
as
needed
but
dont
make
them
too
big
or
they
might
just
pop
and
then
byebye
balloon
itll
be
gone
and
lost
for
the
rest
of
mankind
they
can
serve
a
variety
of
purposes
from
decorating
to
water
balloon
wars
you
just
have
to
use
your
head
to
think
a
little
bit
about
what
to
do
with
them
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
nancy
was
going
to
change
the
world
she
looked
like
an
average
girl
going
to
an
average
high
school
it
was
the
fact
that
everything
about
her
seemed
average
that
would
end
up
becoming
her
superpower
he
swung
back
the
fishing
pole
and
cast
the
line
which
ell
feet
away
into
the
river
the
lure
landed
in
the
perfect
spot
and
he
was
sure
he
would
soon
get
a
bite
he
never
expected
that
the
bite
would
come
from
behind
in
the
form
of
a
bear
i
love
the
feel
of
wood
curls
flying
off
the
lathe
as
i
begin
to
shape
the
log
in
front
of
me
the
sound
of
scraping
changes
based
on
the
wetness
of
the
wood
the
speed
at
which
the
lathe
is
turning
and
the
type
of
cut
i
am
making
the
smell
and
feel
of
wet
wood
being
turned
are
unique
the
water
is
sprayed
out
as
i
cut
through
the
different
layers
of
wood
a
log
can
turn
into
anything
ones
imagination
can
think
of
with
the
right
set
of
handson
tools
i
have
those
hands
and
imagination
i
use
all
of
my
senses
and
intuition
to
create
a
beautiful
object
that
is
why
i
enjoy
turning
wood
he
wondered
if
he
should
disclose
the
truth
to
his
friends
it
would
be
a
risky
move
yes
the
truth
would
make
things
a
lot
easier
if
they
all
stayed
on
the
same
page
but
the
truth
might
fracture
the
group
leaving
everything
in
even
more
of
a
mess
than
it
was
not
telling
the
truth
it
was
time
to
decide
which
way
to
go
all
he
could
think
about
was
how
it
would
all
end
there
was
still
a
bit
of
uncertainty
in
the
equation
but
the
basics
were
there
for
anyone
to
see
no
matter
how
much
he
tried
to
see
the
positive
it
wasnt
anywhere
to
be
seen
the
end
was
coming
and
it
wasnt
going
to
be
pretty
they
needed
to
find
a
place
to
eat
the
kids
were
beginning
to
get
grumpy
in
the
back
seat
and
if
they
didnt
find
them
food
soon
it
was
just
a
matter
of
time
before
they
were
faced
with
a
complete
meltdown
even
knowing
this
the
solution
wasnt
easy
everyone
in
the
car
had
a
different
opinion
on
where
the
best
place
to
eat
would
be
with
nobody
agreeing
with
the
suggestions
of
the
others
it
seemed
to
be
an
impossible
nowin
situation
where
not
everyone
would
be
happy
no
matter
where
they
decided
to
eat
which
in
itself
would
lead
to
a
meltdown
yet
a
decision
needed
to
be
made
and
it
needed
to
be
made
quickly
there
was
a
time
in
his
life
when
her
rudeness
would
have
set
him
over
the
edge
he
would
have
raised
his
voice
and
demanded
to
speak
to
the
manager
that
was
no
longer
the
case
he
barely
reacted
at
all
letting
the
rudeness
melt
away
without
saying
a
word
back
to
her
he
had
been
around
long
enough
to
know
where
rudeness
came
from
and
how
unhappy
the
person
must
be
to
act
in
that
way
all
he
could
do
was
feel
pity
and
be
happy
that
he
didnt
feel
the
way
she
did
to
lash
out
like
that
cake
or
pie
i
can
tell
a
lot
about
you
by
which
one
you
pick
it
may
seem
silly
but
cake
people
and
pie
people
are
really
different
i
know
which
one
i
hope
you
are
but
thats
not
for
me
to
decide
so
what
is
it
cake
or
pie
frank
knew
there
was
a
correct
time
and
place
to
reveal
his
secret
and
this
wasnt
it
the
issue
was
that
the
secret
might
be
revealed
despite
his
best
attempt
to
keep
it
from
coming
out
at
this
point
it
was
out
of
his
control
and
completely
dependant
on
those
around
him
who
also
knew
the
secret
they
wouldnt
purposely
reveal
it
or
at
least
he
believed
that
but
they
could
easily
inadvertently
expose
it
it
was
going
to
be
a
long
hour
as
he
nervously
eyed
everyone
around
the
table
hoping
they
would
keep
their
mouths
shut
he
ordered
his
regular
breakfast
two
eggs
sunnyside
up
hash
browns
and
two
strips
of
bacon
he
continued
to
look
at
the
menu
wondering
if
this
would
be
the
day
he
added
something
new
this
was
also
part
of
the
routine
a
few
seconds
of
hesitation
to
see
if
something
else
would
be
added
to
the
order
before
demuring
and
saying
that
would
be
all
it
was
the
same
exact
meal
that
he
had
ordered
every
day
for
the
past
two
years
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
dream
vacation
they
had
planned
it
over
a
year
in
advance
so
that
it
would
be
perfect
in
every
way
it
had
been
what
they
had
been
looking
forward
to
through
all
the
turmoil
and
negativity
around
them
it
had
been
the
light
at
the
end
of
both
their
tunnels
now
that
the
dream
vacation
was
only
a
week
away
the
virus
had
stopped
all
air
travel
he
sat
staring
at
the
person
in
the
train
stopped
at
the
station
going
in
the
opposite
direction
she
sat
staring
ahead
never
noticing
that
she
was
being
watched
both
trains
began
to
move
and
he
knew
that
in
another
timeline
or
in
another
universe
they
had
been
happy
together
another
option
you
have
is
choosing
the
number
of
syllables
in
the
words
you
speak
you
probably
have
never
considered
this
option
before
but
you
have
it
every
time
you
open
your
mouth
and
speak
you
make
so
many
choices
like
this
that
you
never
even
think
about
but
you
have
the
choice
with
each
one
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
knowledge
she
had
been
told
time
and
time
again
that
the
most
important
steps
were
the
first
and
the
last
it
was
something
that
she
carried
within
her
in
everything
she
did
but
then
he
showed
up
and
disrupted
everything
he
told
her
that
she
had
it
wrong
the
first
step
wasnt
the
most
important
the
last
step
wasnt
the
most
important
it
was
the
next
step
that
was
the
most
important
josh
had
spent
year
and
year
accumulating
the
information
he
knew
it
inside
out
and
if
there
was
ever
anyone
looking
for
an
expert
in
the
field
josh
would
be
the
one
to
call
the
problem
was
that
there
was
nobody
interested
in
the
information
besides
him
and
he
knew
it
years
of
information
painstakingly
memorized
and
sorted
with
not
a
sole
giving
even
an
ounce
of
interest
in
the
topic
i
inadvertently
went
to
sees
candy
last
week
i
was
in
the
mall
looking
for
phone
repair
and
as
it
turns
out
sees
candy
now
charges
a
dollar
a
full
dollar
for
even
the
simplest
of
their
wee
confection
offerings
i
bought
two
chocolate
lollipops
and
two
chocolatecaramelalmond
things
the
total
cost
was
foursomething
i
mean
the
candies
were
tasty
and
all
but
lets
be
real
a
snickers
bar
is
fifty
cents
after
this
dollarpercandy
revelation
i
may
not
find
myself
wandering
dreamily
back
into
a
sees
candy
any
time
soon
the
computer
wouldnt
start
she
banged
on
the
side
and
tried
again
nothing
she
lifted
it
up
and
dropped
it
to
the
table
still
nothing
she
banged
her
closed
fist
against
the
top
it
was
at
this
moment
she
saw
the
irony
of
trying
to
fix
the
machine
with
violence
it
was
difficult
to
explain
to
them
how
the
diagnosis
of
certain
death
had
actually
given
him
life
while
everyone
around
him
was
in
tears
and
upset
he
actually
felt
more
at
ease
the
doctor
said
it
would
be
less
than
a
year
that
gave
him
a
year
to
live
something
hed
failed
to
do
with
his
daily
drudgery
of
a
routine
that
had
passed
as
life
until
then
after
hunting
for
several
hours
we
finally
saw
a
large
seal
sunning
itself
on
a
flat
rock
i
took
one
of
the
wooden
clubs
while
larry
took
the
longer
one
we
slowly
snuck
up
behind
the
seal
until
we
were
close
enough
to
club
it
over
its
head
the
seal
slumped
over
and
died
this
seal
would
help
us
survive
we
could
eat
the
meat
and
fat
the
fat
could
be
burned
in
a
shell
for
light
and
the
fur
could
be
used
to
make
a
blanket
we
declared
our
first
day
of
hunting
a
great
success
sleep
deprivation
causes
all
sorts
of
challenges
and
problems
when
one
doesnt
get
enough
sleep
ones
mind
doesnt
work
clearly
studies
have
shown
that
after
staying
awake
for
hours
ones
ability
to
do
simple
math
is
greatly
impaired
driving
tired
has
been
shown
to
be
as
bad
as
driving
drunk
moods
change
depression
anxiety
and
mania
can
be
induced
by
lack
of
sleep
as
much
as
people
try
to
do
without
enough
sleep
it
is
a
wonder
more
crazy
things
dont
happen
in
this
world
eating
raw
fish
didnt
sound
like
a
good
idea
its
a
delicacy
in
japan
didnt
seem
to
make
it
any
more
appetizing
raw
fish
is
raw
fish
delicacy
or
not
the
blinking
light
caught
her
attention
she
thought
about
it
a
bit
and
couldnt
remember
ever
noticing
it
before
that
was
strange
since
it
was
obvious
the
flashing
light
had
been
there
for
years
now
she
wondered
how
she
missed
it
for
that
amount
of
time
and
what
other
things
in
her
small
town
she
had
failed
to
notice
the
young
man
wanted
a
role
model
he
looked
long
and
hard
in
his
youth
but
that
role
model
never
materialized
his
only
choice
was
to
embrace
all
the
people
in
his
life
he
didnt
want
to
be
like
her
mom
had
warned
her
she
had
been
warned
time
and
again
but
she
had
refused
to
believe
her
she
had
done
everything
right
and
she
knew
she
would
be
rewarded
for
doing
so
with
the
promotion
so
when
the
promotion
was
given
to
her
main
rival
it
not
only
stung
it
threw
her
belief
system
into
disarray
it
was
her
first
big
lesson
in
life
but
not
the
last
i
checked
in
for
the
night
at
out
o
the
way
motel
what
a
bad
choice
that
was
first
i
took
a
shower
and
a
spider
crawled
out
of
the
drain
next
the
towel
rack
fell
down
when
i
reached
for
the
one
small
bath
towel
this
allowed
the
towel
to
fall
halfway
into
the
toilet
i
tried
to
watch
a
movie
but
the
remote
control
was
sticky
and
wouldnt
stop
scrolling
through
the
channels
i
gave
up
for
the
night
and
crawled
into
bed
i
stretched
out
my
leg
and
felt
something
furry
by
my
foot
filled
with
fear
i
reached
down
and
to
my
surprise
i
pulled
out
a
raccoon
skin
pair
of
underwear
after
my
initial
relief
that
it
wasnt
alive
the
image
of
a
fat
ugly
businessman
wearing
raccoon
skin
briefs
filled
my
brain
i
jumped
out
of
the
bed
threw
my
toothbrush
into
my
bag
and
sprinted
towards
my
car
should
he
write
it
down
that
was
the
question
running
through
his
mind
he
couldnt
believe
what
had
just
happened
and
he
knew
nobody
else
would
believe
him
as
well
even
if
he
documented
what
had
happened
by
writing
it
down
he
still
didnt
believe
anyone
would
still
believe
it
so
the
question
remained
was
it
be
worth
it
to
actually
write
it
down
she
closed
her
eyes
and
then
opened
them
again
what
she
was
seeing
just
didnt
make
sense
she
shook
her
head
seeing
if
that
would
help
it
didnt
although
it
seemed
beyond
reality
there
was
no
denying
she
was
witnessing
a
large
formation
of
alien
spaceships
filling
the
sky
the
wolves
stopped
in
their
tracks
sizing
up
the
mother
and
her
cubs
it
had
been
over
a
week
since
their
last
meal
and
they
were
getting
desperate
the
cubs
would
make
a
good
meal
but
there
were
high
risks
taking
on
the
mother
grizzly
a
decision
had
to
be
made
and
the
wrong
choice
could
signal
the
end
of
the
pack
bryan
had
made
peace
with
himself
and
felt
comfortable
with
the
choices
he
made
this
had
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
being
alone
no
longer
bothered
him
and
this
was
essential
since
there
was
a
good
chance
he
might
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
alone
in
a
cell
it
was
just
a
burger
why
couldnt
she
understand
that
she
knew
hed
completely
changed
his
life
around
her
eating
habits
so
why
couldnt
she
give
him
a
break
this
one
time
she
wasnt
even
supposed
to
have
found
out
yes
he
had
promised
her
and
yes
he
had
broken
that
promise
but
still
in
his
mind
all
it
had
been
was
just
a
burger
he
wandered
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
basement
the
damp
musty
smell
of
unuse
hung
in
the
air
a
single
small
window
let
in
a
glimmer
of
light
but
this
simply
made
the
shadows
in
the
basement
deeper
he
inhaled
deeply
and
looked
around
at
a
mess
that
had
been
accumulating
for
over
years
he
was
positive
that
this
was
the
place
he
wanted
to
live
are
you
getting
my
texts
she
texted
to
him
he
glanced
at
it
and
chuckled
under
his
breath
of
course
he
was
getting
them
but
if
he
wasnt
getting
them
how
would
he
ever
be
able
to
answer
he
put
the
phone
down
and
continued
on
his
project
he
was
ignoring
her
texts
and
he
planned
to
continue
to
do
so
its
not
his
fault
i
know
youre
going
to
want
to
but
you
cant
blame
him
he
really
has
no
idea
how
it
happened
i
kept
trying
to
come
up
with
excuses
i
could
say
to
mom
that
would
keep
her
calm
when
she
found
out
what
happened
but
the
more
i
tried
the
more
i
could
see
none
of
them
would
work
he
was
going
to
get
her
wrath
and
there
was
nothing
i
could
say
to
prevent
it
the
answer
was
within
her
reach
it
was
hidden
in
a
box
and
now
that
box
sat
directly
in
front
of
her
shed
spent
years
searching
for
it
and
could
hardly
believe
shed
finally
managed
to
find
it
she
turned
the
key
to
unlock
the
box
and
then
gently
lifted
the
top
she
held
her
breath
in
anticipation
of
finally
knowing
the
answer
she
had
spent
so
much
of
her
time
in
search
of
as
the
lid
came
off
she
could
see
that
the
box
was
empty
it
was
a
simple
green
chair
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
or
so
it
seemed
it
was
the
type
of
chair
one
would
pass
without
even
noticing
it
was
there
let
alone
what
the
actual
color
of
it
was
it
was
due
to
this
common
and
unassuming
appearance
that
few
people
actually
stopped
to
sit
in
it
and
discover
its
magical
powers

the
sun
hung
low
in
the
sky
casting
long
shadows
across
the
tranquil
meadow
a
gentle
breeze
rustled
the
leaves
creating
a
soothing
melody
that
seemed
to
dance
with
the
swaying
grass
birds
chirped
merrily
adding
their
cheerful
notes
to
the
symphony
of
nature
in
the
distance
a
small
stream
gurgled
its
crystalclear
waters
meandering
through
the
rocks
and
pebbles
wildflowers
adorned
the
field
painting
it
with
vibrant
hues
of
red
yellow
and
purple
it
was
a
scene
of
serene
beauty
a
sanctuary
where
time
seemed
to
stand
still
as
the
day
drew
to
a
close
the
horizon
was
ablaze
with
a
breathtaking
display
of
oranges
and
pinks
as
if
the
heavens
themselves
were
celebrating
the
days
end
in
that
moment
all
worries
and
troubles
faded
away
leaving
only
a
profound
sense
of
peace
and
gratitude
for
the
wonders
of
the
natural
world
the
ancient
oak
tree
stood
tall
and
proud
its
gnarled
branches
reaching
out
like
ancient
arms
the
bark
weathered
by
countless
seasons
bore
the
scars
of
time
and
told
stories
of
years
long
past
a
canopy
of
emerald
leaves
formed
a
protective
umbrella
filtering
the
dappled
sunlight
that
kissed
the
forest
floor
below
moss
and
ferns
carpeted
the
ground
creating
a
lush
tapestry
of
greenery
squirrels
darted
playfully
among
the
branches
their
tails
flicking
in
excitement
the
air
was
thick
with
the
earthy
scent
of
damp
soil
and
the
sweet
fragrance
of
wildflowers
as
a
gentle
breeze
rustled
the
leaves
it
carried
with
it
the
soft
whispers
of
natures
secrets
in
this
enchanted
forest
time
seemed
to
move
at
its
own
leisurely
pace
as
if
the
world
beyond
was
but
a
distant
dream
he
cityscape
stretched
out
before
me
a
symphony
of
steel
and
glass
that
reached
for
the
heavens
skyscrapers
soared
into
the
sky
their
windows
reflecting
the
golden
hues
of
the
setting
sun
the
streets
below
bustled
with
life
a
cacophony
of
car
horns
footsteps
and
chatter
people
hurried
along
the
sidewalks
each
lost
in
their
own
world
yet
all
connected
by
the
pulse
of
the
metropolis
neon
signs
illuminated
the
night
casting
a
vibrant
glow
upon
the
urban
landscape
from
this
vantage
point
i
could
see
it
allthe
energy
the
diversity
the
endless
possibilities
that
a
city
offers
it
was
a
place
where
dreams
were
born
and
destinies
were
forged
a
place
where
the
human
spirit
thrived
amidst
the
hustle
and
bustle
as
day
turned
to
night
the
citys
heartbeat
grew
stronger
a
reminder
that
life
in
this
concrete
jungle
never
truly
slept
