\begin{comment}
	IF YOU DISPLAY CODE OR MATH PLOTS, USE THE '-shell-escape' COMPILATION OPTION
	This file is a template for LaTeX document. To create a pdf file, you need to compile the tex file but use :
		pdflatex yourTexFile.tex
		
	All the lines beginning by %% are commented lines to explain the code to the user (file wont' compile if you delete both %)
	All the lines beginning by % are lines containing a package : some things in LaTeX need macros to be made and macros are imported by the :
		\usepackage{macro name}
	So, to use a package, just delete the % at the beginning of the line
	For each package, a comment section will describe what is the goal of the current package and how to use it. A single %% line will be display above it to make a sum up.
	If you need more information about a specific package, you can go on https://ctan.org/pkg/ and search for the package you need, they give the documentation

	Some lines can't be deleted, otherwise the file won't compile. It's always mentionned when it's the case.
